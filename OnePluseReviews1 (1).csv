0,The same thing happening in the new replaced phone also I feel disappointed it's not worth for the money. It's hanging a lot in phone application. I am getting irritated when I am try to make a call. I need to wait for 30 to 40 seconds in that to most of the time it closing automatically showing phone is not responding. I didn't expect this from one plus. Totally waste product...
1,Everything is best except the thing that one plus hasn't provided headphones with handset..n even cleaning cloth is not there...only one transparent cover case is available..phone doesn't have headphones jack n hence it should have provided headphones..mine is mirror Black..
2,Do watch the video. M very disappointed with the product
3,"Awesome device, and hats off to amazon for such speedy delivery.I ordered it on 16th May 12PM and it got delivered by 17th May 10AMAnd so far I m absolutely loving this device, buttery smooth and blazing fast. But its a bit big, afterall 6.7 inches is quite a number and super slippery if used without the case.And I am awestruck by the speed it charges. üòç"
4,Worth every buck.Finally one plus has involved and presented a better shaped handset.- Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.- Best in class camera.- Better battery life and charging.
5,"Waste of money this time one plus 7 pro heavy weight not disply gud compare to samsung, also inbuilt screen guard getting with bubles and in youtube show wireless headphone and 2 axtra cover with phone but not recived this time really waste of money"
6,This phone has a hanging issue. Nd ur customer care says they can send d technician on 25th. Its like  i hv spent 53000 nd still i cant use a phone.
7,No 4G direct video call!! What a mess! Clearly over priced. Display is stunning. Performance stunning. Average battery backup. Over hiped device as usual!! Worst RAM management! Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.
8,just bought oneplus 7 prowas exploring itsaved both of my thumbs as fingerprint but the phone opened with my right index fingerprintwhat the hell is this
9,"I am giving 1 star for poor camera quality .The camera is bad than my oneplus 3.Its not able to focus correctly and the final image is blurry.I discovered the issue when clicking a pic of a document.The text was not sharp and all and after doing some more testing with 3rd party apps , and going thru Oneplus Forum, found that many people are facing this same issue.Oneplus should fix this issue, else this would be like OP 2"
10,I have been using this phone for about last 4 days and the best part about this phone is the display it's truly gorgeous once you start using 1440P 90Hz display I bet you won't even feel using the 1080p display and the cherry on the top is its OLED black is black and all the colours looks just so great that it makes viewing experience like you are sitting in a IMAX.Alright enough about the display now speaking about the camera I think over the updates oneplus will improve it but still as of today it's still performs quite well in well lit environment but it underperfoms in low light environment however nightscape mode works quite well but I hope for the oneplus improvvs it over the updates.Under producing selfie camera performs well and I really like that it has a free fall detection which is like and insurance for your phoneSpeaking about the battery if you're going to game then I guess you will get around 4 hours of screen on time on 1440 p at 90 hz but if you are going to use this phone as a daily driver then it can get you through all the day I charge my phone at 7 in the morning and when I came back home at around 12 o'clock at the night I still had around 20% battery left so it's quite good for me.Other Interesting features like the processor of this phone the beauty of this phone and the glass back and its display is just Cherry on the top.In conclusion this is by far the best phone I have ever bought if you are going to buy any phone at around 50k price. Then definitely go for this and I think 8GB RAM variant is good enough I don't know why they made 12 GB variant
11,"First time I have purchased one plus phone (one plus 7 pro) but my experience is very bad due to phone camera quality and battery life. Pictures are blur and camera can't focus on subject, pictures showing good in camera before clicking but after click picture goes blur. I have done every troubleshooting but problem is still same. Battery also work for 4-5 hours. So I want to return it. Because I have spent a very big amount on this phone but I am very disappointed by Amazon and one plus."
12,"One plus 7 pro is sold at a higher price and the device doesn't justify that, with no headphone jack and a dismal battey life i would suggest to wait for one plus 7. They don't include type - c to 3.5 jack connector in the box. WHEN I SAY THAT BATTERY LIFE IS POOR I SERIOUSLY MEAN IT. you barely get 4 hrs on time with the screen with 90hz, they have included 60hz option in the settings but which fool would change from 90 to 60hz ? the 90hz will spoil you and you will NEVER go back to 60hz screen. As i said the mobile overall is average not bad. They have provided a WARP charger which charges like crazy fast which will somehow 'compensate' a bad battery ?  NO  There were numerous occasions where i had to charge 3-4 times a day of heavy usage. The WARP charger charges the device to 50% in 20 min which is the only reason why i haven't gone for refund, really.As for the camera, it's 'average' for a flagship device. One plus pro are a premium rage smartphones which aims to compete with flagships, it isn't a 'flagship killer' but a 'flagship contender'The photos on bright sunlight and good lighting are good but fally horribly bad on low lighting and night time. So dismal.Some neat features in this device is that it is really smart , the sensors are top notch and detect the phone movement so scarily accurate . For example when you life the device from the table or a bed or whatever the sensors detect the movement and the screen lights up for you to check for notifications, note that this isn't because the front cam detects your 'ugly' face because the front cam is neatly sealed inside the device and it pops up when you need to take a selfie or a face recognition unlock with help of a magnetic motor. The device's screen is good not great i don't understand why there is a huge fuss around it.One more thing i have noted is that the vibrating motor in this device is very top class, they have clearly put a lot of effort in perfecting it, you can set the vibration intensity to match you satisfaction, be careful though if it is too high, when the mobile vibrates you too vibrate along with it :)I , thus conclude by stating that this device is a very 'average' 'smart' phone with a good screen which also happends to be a flagship for one plus company."
13,"Very bad product, many functions doesn't work, I have OnePlus 5 and I didn't feel any issue with my old phone till now, don't buy, you will regret, and also Amazon support won't help you at all, they are even more worst üò°üò°üò°"
14,"One of the best phones I have used, be it android or iOS.The performance is buttery smooth, compared side by side with a Oneplus 6T, and 90hz display really makes a hell lot of difference.Updated to the 9.5.4 available while writing the review, and the battery life is awesome, getting 6 hrs screen on time with 90hz display. Camera is decent, just put the GCam, and it becomes a versatile camera option to shoot in different scenarios.Warp charging is the highlight and really charges the phone pretty quick, I don't miss my dash charging even with this huge battery.The haptic motor is finally really good, and now typing and other small tasks gives that satisfying vibrations.Stereo speakers are of really good quality and they are loud and clear.As for the headphone jack and adapter, everyone should know that before getting this device, spending ‚Çπ50k for a device without prior research is your mistake. Sure they should have given atleast an adapter, but it's no reason to give this one star.Overall, really awesome device, much better than the exynos galaxy that we get here in India."
15,I am very disappointed with one plus there are no wireless charging and earphones with the phone in 53k u must go with 26k-55k vivo Samsung or apple also they giving you this standard Assesories with the phone.about hand set phone screen resolution is perfect üëåcamera is perfect and design also perfect üëå
16,Bad experience with Amazon and onepluse.I have problems in touch but they don't accept replace immediately.Touch not working properly in a day 2_3 times it's automatically touch and phone start various application without any touch closing and open. Customer care taking too long time and assign technical assistance after on 27  may . Don't buySame problem after replacement but now ok after os update. Best phone in 50k range
17,The product was received in good packaging condition.. The phone is awesome except that the selfie popup camera isn't working.. It refuses to come out & instead an error message pops up for the camera..
18,"Before going to buy this product let me tell some truth... Camera is at it's worst, after buying this  phone  I got 2 updates and last one specific for camera  but still it's same as before after updateScreen quality  just like a normal lcd panel phone , I switched from pixel XL but that was my biggest mistake I can say that.Now the funniest thing is my phone's front camera taking 15-20 second to popup and Amazon tech support says that's normal üòÅüòÅ. Amazon says no return policy is there for this phone so yeah you are going to regret after buying this piece of junk, don't listen to the YouTubbers they are just paid for that. I am writing this review after 10 days of use."
19,Phone is like a brick. Very heavy. I mean you can't talk without headphones. Interesting thing is one plus calling this premium phone. They have the audacity to give this phone without earphone and any kind of adapter from type c to 3.55. Thats arrogance at it's best. Basically you are stuck and spend whole lot of money for Bluetooth ear phone. Only saving grace of this phone is performance. Ui is not great and very old. Vivo has better ui than this phone. Buy if you want to shell out extra money for simple things like adapter and all.  It is not water resistant too. No it's rating. This is my first and last one plus.

21,"I completely Loved the display quality , sound quality , finger print sensor , Pop up camera, wide angle , 3x zoom and night scape camera. I disappointed a bit by not having a 3.5 mm ear phone jack. Coming to the story of battery life one plus 7 pro is 4000 milliamp which is having 9 hrs 45 minutes battery life where as one plus 6t is 3700 milliamp which is having 10 hrs battery life . I was disappointed with this too. I was totally stunned by the speediness of fingerprint sensor absolutely stunned .  I think everything is fine with the New one plus 7 pro and I am absolutely and delightfully enjoying the experience of New one plus 7 pro . Basically I am a movie lover. I am enjoying the HD movies like I am watching in movie theater. Dolby Atmos sound quality adds this phone to become high priority than others ."
22,"Definitely worth every single Penny spent on it. The display and performance are absolutely mind blowing. Camera may not be the best but it's still top class. The phone isn't as big as people would think it is. It's actually pretty sleek and feels nice in the hands as it isn't very broad. The battery performance is commendable given the 90hz refresh rate and the QHD display. Would easily last a day on normal usage. Although, Heavy users would require around half an hour of charging. Warp charge is super fast, you won't even realise how quickly your phone charges after you plug it in. Oxygen works buttery smooth and as a first time user of this UI, I'm liking it quite a lot. Gaming is wonderful too, absolutely smooth, beautiful and lag free. The accompanying phone cover is good too, it just gets smudged by finger prints though. As someone who watched reviews of different phones and was well versed with what I was buying, I'm enjoying every second of using this phone.Most of the reviewers here are complaining about not receiving headphones and extra covers and a screen guard with bubbles, it's absolutely absurd. You should atleast look over what you're buying first thoroughly, and any reasonable man would have easily found out what he's get in the box and what he's not getting. These illiterate people buy stuff without knowing anything and then expect candies in the damn box and when they don't get it, write negative reviews which influence other queer buyers. It's highly unfortunate.For all those looking for the best performing Device available right now, go for it, if you can compromise with the headphone jack (get a 3.5mm to c type cable and problem solved). Everything from the looks and feel to the performance of the phone is amazing. You'll feel that you're holding a flagship masterpiece every second you're holding this phone. It's easily the best phone in it's price range hands down."
23,Battery is a weak.. Needs to charge twice a dayAnd apps also keep crashing... In between...Thr is a bug in which lock screen ambient light won't work sumtimes
24,Didn't received Bluetooth headphone and car charger with mobile. As it was told in the launch event that one plus seven will give both these products with package.
25,SO this phone is probably the best Android phone till date and even better than ios ehen it comes to camera and speed‚ù§Ô∏èI HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 2 DAYS FOLLOWING ARE THE PROS-1)NO LAG IN GAMING2) ULTIMATELY FAST CHARGING3) THE EDGES ON SCREEN GIVE PREMIUM FEELING4) DUAL SPEAKERS ARE SERIOUSLY USEFUL5) THE TOUCH AND DISPLAY IS VERY SMOOTH6) CAMERA IS A BEAST BOTH FRONT AND BACK CAMERAFOLLOWING ARE CONS-NONE XD AS A CONCLUSION--THE SPEED IS UNMATCHABLE-IN HAND FEEL IS VERY PREMIUM-CAMERA WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN-WARP CHARGING IS VERY QUICKHOPE THIS HELPSüôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
26,"Neither a flagship phone nor a flagship killer. It's an expensive joke..  Mi note 5 pro camera is far far better than this idot box.  48 MP camera is a joke.  The tech reviewers gave biased reviews. Don't even try to compare with MI note 7 pro 48MP setup.  Nothing in the product will amaze you,  you will end up with a huge disappointment... Ram management is pathetic,  battery is below average.  Go for google pixel rather than this."
27,"Big issue with touchscreen..when I try n write it starts video call on wattsapp.. I am trying to write a review the page is closing automatically. After spending 50k if you face such issues, it's disappointing.. I don't know if this issue is because I ordered from Amazon.. I will not recommend this phone to anyone.. I want to return this n want a good phone in working condition or else my refund."
28,"I didn't believe the reviewers. I bought the phone. And now I don't like any other phones except OnePlus 7 Pro.90Hz - It's madness. Imagine this - Drinking alcohol is injurious to health, but if you drink it you'll feel good. Right? 90Hz would give you the best smartphone experience, but it drains some more battery compared to 60Hz. Moderate drinking is perfectly fine; charging the phone 2 times a day is fine too. (I'm a heavy user)Warp charger - Charges the phone at remarkable speeds. If you're a previous OnePlus user, you won't find much of a difference.Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.My favorite retarded reviews :*Someone was upset that he couldn't find a 'OnePlus backpack' and a 'OnePlus water bottle' in the package.*Someone was upset that he found an air bubble under the phone's screen guard."
29,I was a follower of OnePlus but after this phone I am not going to by OnePlus phones anymore. I got screen burning on multiple spots on this phone.Those people call it a gaming phone & when I play games for couple of hours a day it gets screen burning....so what kind of gaming phone is this.I bought Samsung Tab S6 for gaming....this phone just remain as yet another phone
30,"Upgraded from my OnePlus 6 just a few days back after using OnePlus 6 for about 10 months or so.Initial observation :1. QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. No notch whatsoever.3. Near Stock Android experience.4. OP is great in pushing updates regularly which is a rare thing even with Samsung's flagship phones.Pro's :1.  QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Near Stock Android experience with some very useful features like screen recorder, ability to switch between QHD & FHD+, etc3. Fast Charging (coutsey OPPO's VOOC Charge 3).4. Good ROM options.5. ZEN mode to log you out of the smartphone for 20 minutes.6. Full screen without a notch makes video streaming a great experience.7. Apps open fast, really fast.8. Pop Up camera is really fast during face recognition. Many times you may not even notice that the POP UP camera really came out of the slot retracted. It's that fast.CON's :1. Battery drain gets hampered if you run it in QHD with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Camera is not up to the mark as compared to OnePlus 6 apart from the options of wide angle. (maybe software update will improve its usability, perticularly while shooting videos in wide angle).3 Camera clicks 12 MP shots in default mode. Night mode is so-so but don't compare it with Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL or even with Pixel 3a XL. Pixel is way ahead in terms of resolution perticularly in night mode.4. Day time photos are much better when compared to OnePlus 6 perticularly where good light is not an issue. Photography during ""conference"" might be tricky. This is where Pixel will overshadow all other smartphones.5. This is a big phone in the territory of a tablet. Handling it might be a bit difficult for some. Single hand use is not advisable.Will update after a few more days of use.UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF USAGE :Most of the users of OnePlus 7 Pro (as per the reviews) would be happy with budget handset like Redmi or Realme as they are either using OnePlus 7 Pro for the sake of it or to play games. Whether your handset has 2GB RAM free or not has nothing to do with the performance. What makes a difference is the availability of RAM for a perticular task. RAM management is very good like all the previous OnePlus devices.IPhone XS Max also doesn't give a headset or even a dongle to use it with 3.5 mm headphone jack but people do buy iPhone without thinking twice. Iphone doesn't even give fast charging brick in the box. When people can spend a lack of rupees for a brand why complain about OnePlus 7 Pro.Call quality of OP 7 Pro is good. Even video calling over Whatsapp and Skype is good.It's a pleasure using OnePlus 7 Pro for creating Word documents, PPT's, Excel Sheets on the go. These apps use a lot of battery and RAM. Adobe Reader is just fluid. RAM management while using these apps and switching between them is just beautiful and seamless.Will update after a few more days......As expected, OnePlus released an update on the general performance and camera issue.Camera quality is quite subjective and uncontrollable since everyone can capture an awful photo in a random scenario. Even though the photo is not quite bad technically, there is always someone giving negative opinion only for the reason that he likes more appealing photo style. Every time when there is a photo sent to us due to negative feedback, our engineers are requested to find the same light condition and object of same color and texture to simulate the photo in order to reproduce the same problem. You can imagine the time and workload needed for fixing every single problem, not to mention the dozens of photos we got from all over the world everyday. We hope you guys could understand and allow us more time keep working on the camera.ONEPLUS COMMUNITY LISTENS...."
31,"There are air bobbles on the screen , request has been placed for return, let see what they would suggest"
32,"Please don't buy it now, it is not picking up the network time. Maybe a software issue and Amazon would be sending a technician today but they wouldn't replace or refund it."
33,Brought a phone @53K it's Heats a lot.....even in normal use it's become üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• .... There's no option for return Amazon... Say download the app n that app is completely useless it shows 42¬∞ as normal temperature really disappoint  one should go with another brand Google pixel or iPhone
34,display- 5 starlook- 4 starprocessor- no need to be ratedbattery- 4 star. more thn my expectations at qhd nd 90hzgood sound not one of d best stereo speakers
35,Amazing phone I have never given reviews about anything on internet but after reading some bad comments insisted me to write one good comment. Guys don't know people are mad or there luck is too bad that they have received some dabba but in one line I can garrentee you .... That u can't find better phone then this. I have used iPhone Samsung Sony Nokia redmi oppo but after using  one plus specially 7 pro I can't think I would buy some other phone.Best of the best
36,Good and awesome experience in one plus 7 proGood battery lifeGood cameraGood for pubgBig screen and sound quality is also goodWorking in good condition let's see... I used this almost 10 days suddenly my wake screen and double tap to wake the screen is not working properly
37,"Got it in a day, and have been using it for a day, till now the experience is quite good, here are the pros and cons I noticed-Pros-1. The display is absolutely amazing 90Hz refresh rate makes everything make more fluid, plus the HDR support is a good feature since they are tying up with Netflix to bring HDR content, although some apps have not used the curves at top and bottom of the screen properly.2. The phone is fast and I mean damn fast, thanks to the Qualcomm SD 855.3. Battery life lasts about a day with medium use, with heavy use with QHD and 90Hz kept on, the battery drains fast. But  with the WRAP30 charger it charges pretty fast.4. The UFS3.0 storage is very fast.5. The phone design looks good, one of the best looking smartphones with a glass back.Cons-1. The biggest con is it has no headphone jack AND no USB-C to 3.5mm converter or USB-C headphone is provided with this, so you have to shell out extra bucks for that.2. The upcoming OnePlus 7 still has SD855 and 48MP processor, although it costs about 32999.3. The camera is nothing unique for a flagship, but still captures good photo even in lowlight.4. No wireless charging.5. No official water proof rating.6. It's very slippery due to the glass back, so if you've tendency of dropping phones definitely get a cover. Although finger smudges are easy to clean on it unlike the Google Pixel.Over all it's great phone and one can go for it."
38,"Review after a week of using:Display:It's as good as it gets. Super AMOLED with 90Hz refresh rate. The colours are vivid and contents are crisp, also, with the video enhancement ratio turned on, the contrast ratio is really kicking in. However, you do not get a Samsung or Apple level display but at this price point, this is a steal.Display Rating - 9/10.Sound:Dolby Atmos gives you the stereo sound that OnePlus has promised and it makes you feel immersed in whatever video you're watching or game you're playing with addition to the full screen display. However, it's not the best sound I've heard on a phone, but it's much better than a lot of phones. And also, it doesn't have ""equal"" amplitude of sound coming out of both speakers. The bottom one is more powerful, probably because it's the main speaker for ringtones. Overall, it's a good speaker for normal users, for audiophiles - not so great.Sound rating - 8/10Camera:When I first turned the camera on, my mind was blown, probably because of the cheerleading effect of the high quality AMOLED display, but even so, it put up competition with devices that took photo with Google Camera Mod or even the Google Pixel's camera as well. In some cases it was great, in some it was lacking. Overall, the dynamic range is great but not the best. The colours are more true to life, and in the normal / auto camera mode it offers an image of size 12MP. True 48MP images can be taken with the pro mode, and if you can set your camera up properly, you can take amazing photos of the milky way and stars, so it's a powerful camera. The Ultra-Wide camera needs some work done as the details look washed out on the pictures taken Ultra-Wide angle lens. The telephoto lens does its job well up to 3x zoom, but it does produce a tad bit of noise. And the night mode is especially good, it preserves the highlights and details and also lightens up the shadows during very challenging conditions. Amazing night mode. And as for selfies, yes, it's amazing, offering upto 16MP including the precise edge detection in portrait mode of both the back and front, the cameras are great. The OnePlus 7 Pro offers video recording of upto 4K 60FPS which is great and offers slow mo video of upto 240fps in 720p. However, there was a really annoying little problem, which was shutter lag, that's probably because of the software and I hope OnePlus improves that. Otherwise some pictures might be ruined because of it. Overall the camera is decent, and not the best.Camera Rating: 8/10Fingerprint Scanner: Even though it's an optical image fingerprint sensor in the age of newly invented ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, it's fast. Not as much as the physical ones but it's definitely the fastest optical fingerprint sensor I've ever used. And the animation looks cool.Fingerprint scanner rating: 9/10UI: OxygenOS is the best UI you can get from a company. It is definitely smooth, fast and easy to use and doesn't look like a bootleg Android and at least it doesn't annoy people with bloatwares and advertisements in the utility apps. It has a lot of features and is highly customizable.UI Rating: 10/10Build: As much sexy as it looks, the OnePlus 7 Pro is fragile if it falls from your hands. Although glass looks premium and feels premium, I'd rather prefer a metal aluminium body. However, with the addition of curved display, a mechanical camera and the glass back, I'm in love with the design. It is definitely one of it's major selling points. The only other con is the lack of headphone jack, but it would have been consider if OnePlus would have at least included a pair of type-C headphones or at least a type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack converter. Keep up the good work, OnePlus!Build rating: 8/10Hardware: The OnePlus 7 Pro rocks a Snapdragon 855 chipset with Adreno 640, and everything you run on this device from games to Antutu 3D benchmarks, everything runs as smooth as butter with no fps drop or stuttering whatsoever, and doesn't heat up very much as well. However it still doesn't surpass a lot of phones if you match the scores.Hardware rating: 9/10In the Box content: In the box you get a 30W Warp Charge supported charging block with cool red type C cable to charge your phone, a flexible rubber case which is a good addition, some papers with a letter from Pete Lau but unfortunately not type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter or type-C headphones. Huge disappointment.In the Box contents rating: 7/10So overall, we can conclude the OnePlus 7 Pro is a fantastic device but the price could have been at least 3K INR less, even after considering the lack of headphones or the converter, and to retain its title of ""Flagship Killer"". Unfortunately, OnePlus has lost it.Overall Rating: 8.5/10"
39,"I love itI got a screen on time of 6hrs in my first charge itself, battery life will only improve from here and my other concern was the camera, I was pleasantly surprised here it's a good camera but you have to adjust your expectations it's not pixel or p30pro good, in good light you can take some very detailed images , everything else it just works and it's no small thing , the whole experience of using this phone feels refined. I'll list out some pros and cons as wellPros1. Display is awesome and the curve is not bothering me at all2. The speakers get plenty loud and sound pretty good for a smartphone speaker3. It didn't feel too heavy to me and I enjoy the big display4. Charging is really fast and so is the UI5. Main cameraCons1.Could have priced it a bit more competitively"

41,"Hi Team,I would like to bring this to your attention that the warp charger is charging really slow and not at all upto the mark. I am not sure if it has been changed during delivery or it was packaged like that. Although I am really happy with the phone's performance and battery life however the charger is not upto the mark. I charged my phone with my sister's dash charger and it charged my phone almost 3 times faster than warp charger.If possible, please pass it to the oneplus team or look into the delivery process.Thanks & Regards,Sahban khan"
42,Macro mode ?

Worth purchase with no cons."
44,Worst phone not worth buying. Very bad launched by OnePlus..... Facing ghost issues and Amazon not taking it bay
45,"Overall it's a average mobile,, not any special than 6t. I have got a damaged piece.. never expected this from amazon"
46,"There is no filter option in camera, even camera quality is really bad, night light camera is disaster. Phone speed is fine, battery not that strong."
47,Slightly heavy to carry.. great buy with top of the line specifications.. excellent camera.. found it a bit slower than one plus 6 I used... perhaps improve with updates and AI..

49,"Screen is good. Camera is just ok. Fingerprint scanner is bad. Heating too much. No earphone, no 3.5 adaptor. Overall waste of money. Can't expect such bad performance from one plus. They have started cheating customers. This is not at all a flagship phone"

No earphones provided bcos for 50k phone earphones should y provided.2. A rugged protective case would have been welcome3. No type C converter provided.4. Battery life is average but fast charger makes life easy.
51,"Dear Mr Bezos,I am writing this in grief that the product which I received is malfunction and I tried to return this product on day 2 of me buying it , but as per your amazon policy money was not refundable . Is it good to take people hard earned money and become rich with all this schemes , before amazon was never like this . You can check call records even I have contacted your company executives not once but twice. Days passed and it the 16th day of this phone the phone has an issue as when I using an app like watsapp while texting it opens the profile of the person whom I am texting , plus it opens up the the other app . I don't know what problem is this . I urged your executive even that mamm I don't require the money , I would be ordering iPhone XR but then also she said a clear no . Experience WD one plus flagship phone is getting pathetic with every passing day.Regards,A genuine customer who has been using Amazon to buy online product always but this experience made me felt disgusted and pathetic."
52,"I have received a handset with a faulty mic, as soon as i m on call the person on the other hand seems to have disturbance in the voice call this happen when i m on mic as soonnas i switch to speakers it vanishes and everything works fine but the thing is i have purcahsed a phone to make a normal call not speaker call. I have been to the service store they said take the back up of the phone and hand over to us. It means that ordering the device early is stupidity. Now it can happen they will open the phone and the water proof pressure will be damaged, not happy at all."
53,Got my hands on the first prime day sale and arrived two days later.This phone is a fresh breath of air the. The OS is silky smooth  and no lag whatsoever . One plus did an excellent job with their oxygen OS with great optimization . The 90 Hz display makes the experience much more better . You can change it to typical 60 Hz for a long lasting battery hours but who cares when you have a 90hz display. Browsing and scrolling is super smooth and playing games is a bliss thanks to the snapdragon 855 SoC . Been using it for the past two days and the battery life is good . Gets you throughout the day without excessive game play sessions and the latest UFS 3.0 provides blazing fast data transfer.  I get an average of 8 hr of screen on time with full charge and speaking of charging the latest warp charge charges the device from 40 to 100 in around 25 minutes which is fast. I am happy with the device as it is my first one plus device . Looking forward to using it for more than 2 years.

55,"I just upgraded from OnePlus 5tDisplay- the best display on any smartphone!I saw the good reviews on this mobile's display but damn! I didn't expect it to be this good!, I have a S10 in my home for comparison and I can surely say this is as good as Samsung'sBuild- I waited for nebula blue and it's worth the wait! It looks awesome, build quality is excellent but a bit hefty but manageable and u will get used to it in one dayCamera- this is the main part, I don't know whether it's due to my low expectations on camera due to all the negativity but I'm genuinely surprised with the camera, even for this I compared it with S10 and it's pretty close to S10, low light photography is a major improvement and it's on par with S10 which is considered as best in low light other than HuaweiSo don't believe all the negativity, I wonder people who are putting negative review are using DSLR for their daily photo needs.. the only negative would be the wide angle lens is not upto the mark and the one on S10 is way betterVery happy with the camera..Battery- way better than my 5t and easily getting upto 7hrs of screen on time with moderate to heavy usage and warp charge is the best!Performance- no need to say specially about performance coz it's OnePlus!855 with 90hz display, the fastest phone in the world!Others- call quality excellent, sound output via Bluetooth excellent, fingerprint sensor excellent, vibration feedback excellent, no ip rating but totally waterproof.Overall an excellent package and it's worth the premium price!Important note: 3x telephoto lens will not be active if the object is at less than 50cm distance from the lens and in very low light scenarios in such cases the main sensor is used for zoom for better quality..."
56,"This is my first ever Android phone, after being an iPhone user for over a decade. The device is superb and fast. Apps work like breeze and overall, Oxygen OS feels clean and fast like iOS. There are several stability issues that I've seen. Most notably, things like the fingerprint scanner do not always work as expected, the double tap feature doesn't always work and the curvature of the screen leads to unwanted taps. The 48Mp camera is pretty good indeed however, I've noticed an occasional focusing issue that prevents the camera from focussing correctly under certain conditions.But I guess Android phones are never perfect simply because their software is not particularly built for the hardware. So, I'm pretty cool with these issues so far, unless something escalates further. Overall, I'm very impressed by the device. Its well built, charges quickly, takes good photos, sounds well and performs well.What I'm more interested in seeing are these minor glitches go away with OTA updates as is popular in the OnePlus community. Apple has never been very responsive to minor complaints and their updates take ages to appear. OnePlus, from what I've heard is very responsive to customer complaints and I'm hoping things become better with upcoming updates.Till then I'm finding 1 - 2 star reviews on Amazon really amusing with people reporting things like a missing screen cleaning cloth, wireless headphones. Get a life people, and buy these on your own."
57,"One plus 7 pro is an awesome phone no doubts.I am a very strong Apple fan, still i used 99% apple products.I have iphone too, but openly say compare to one plus 7 pro, i phone is nothing.Superb camera,superb perfomance.8 gb ram and 256 gb storage capacity around 52, 000/-.Both front and back cameras are awesome.Good phone for gaming people also.Good wide display.Good sound quality.Superb design.No doubts this is best phone in market now.One plus have good brand name too.What I dislike is 1.) Little over weight. 2.)Battery life not that much better.(One day average)3)No headphone Jacket or head phone with this phone.All other features are superb, inbuilt call record, app lock etc etc."
58,"I am writing the review after using the product for one week.1. Display & Hardware : That's probably the first thing you'll notice about the phone. There is a massive 6.67-inch screen. (too much for me). The design is rich and lusturous.There is an anti-glare coating at the back which gives a matte-like finish. The all-screen design makes the display amazing. Also, it is the first phone of the brand to offer Quad HD+ Fluid AMOLED panel. And most importantly, the screen is curved on both edges (like recent Samsung flagships).What makes the phone truly stand out is the 90Hz refresh rate. The display is also rated for HDR10+2. Camera : There's a primary 48MP f/1.6 camera backed by an 8MP telephoto lens and 16MP wide-angle shooter.The wide-angle lens offers a 117-degree field of view, and the 8MP telephoto delivers 3x optical zoom. And it is just amazing!! The camera is works amazing in daylight conditions. The night-mode is also good, but don't expect it to compete the Pixel 3 and galaxy S10s. Also, the pop up camera is an amazing addon!!3. Software : You really don't need the review for that.But few good things are- native screen recorder, OxygenOS 9.5, Fnatic Mode and Sen mode.4. Processing : The device is fast, really fast. From face recognition to 90Hz display to OxygenOS' clean interface. It is the fastest device I've ever used. (8/256 Version)5. Battery Life : The OnePlus 7 Pro has a 4000mAh battery, but because of the 90Hz display, I struggled to last it for a day. also, the  Warp Charge delivers a 30W charge. You'll be able to charge from 0-50% in just over 20 minutes, and up to 50% in 30 minutes while gaming.6. Weight : The large screen and the 4000 mAh battery leads to 206g weight. The OnePlus 7 Pro feels too top-heavy, and that makes the device unwieldy.7. Major Cons- too heavy, massive screen, no earphones included (paying 53k, I expected earphones), night mode camera is fairly average, no wireless charging, No IP rating , No 3.5 mm jack.Final verdict - I am postively biased for OnePlus always. But yes, since the price range has moved significantly, the expectations from the device have been significantly increased as well. Still this is one of the most ambitious phones, I've ever used. So, please go and buy it!.P.S. Personal review!"
59,"Loved itI liked everything in this mobileIt is smooth, fast, powerfulThe latest Oxygen OS.ALL ARE SUPERI liked very much is it's PREMIUM DISPLAY.....You feel yourself as superior.1+ is a brand that no one can beat or at least touch.Some rival companies are saying that flagship killer is coming but I would say you can never beat a Oxygen OS......If you are affordable for this just blindly go for the pro .......Even if you feel it as expensive, gather money & definitely go for this.There are some minor quality issues with cameraBut surely by the time you read this review 1+ would have definitely posted an update and fixed those small thingsüôÇ.........Never compare 1+ with other brands they are not even worth to sit beside 1+.........You definitely get these thoughts like me after having this phone in your hands............Feel free to ask your queries ......."
60,I felt bad only on one thing regarding the delivery of the product..I ordered the product on 16th May in early sale for prime members and it was supposed to be deliver on next day 17th May 2019 before 9 pm. But I recieved the product in Monday 20th May only..it was such a very bad experience with Amazon Becz even though I was a prime customer I recieved the product very late.. I raised many issues and complaints within that date to get the product on time. I felt very bad about the delivery service of Amazon team..Note regarding the beast and flagship of 2K19.. we happy to buy one plus product again. I was already using one plus 6 for the last 8 months. Always the one plus is so fast and good in performance and built quality. The same and with more performance and balanced Battery back up in the new one plus 7 pro. The box itself was awesome. The phone build quality is remarkable. The display is the main highlight of the product such an awesome clarity and movie experience on the phone. The fast movement with 90hz is really awesome. Felt like new whenever I use the phone. Camera quality has been improved a lot. Day time the photos are awesome and the new nightscape is also good .. The front camera is better and fast. Overall I can give 8.5/10 for camera Becz there is still some lag in picture quality and the contrast of colours while taking a picture when compared to other flagship mobiles. Next the most fastest indisplay finger print is speechless.. no lag or no delay even in extreme dark.. happy that the one plus products are always awesome and they are continuously improving the products. The battery was little bit okay for me im getting just 5 hours of screen time only. But I Hope that the upcoming updates will improve the battery life. So I can give 8/10 for battery and 10/10 for performance. The animation is also awesome whenever we open the phone through finger print the live wallpaper is remarkable. Overall I'm very much happy to buy this awesome product only I felt little bad about the price and there was no connector for earphones. The price is not too high but I expected little less. Anyways this is the new beast of 2K19. Since I won't be playing that much games so I bought 6gb variant Becz last time I bought 8gb variant it will be even more faster but drains the battery fastly. So I decided to go on with 6gb. I recommend everyone to buy this flagship killer and those who will use the phone for more personal and normal use they can easily go with 6gb variant
61,"Fastest Android phone on Earth!Samsung, Redmi, Apple, etc etc... Beware guys!Superb Amazon delivery services.Pros1. Lightening speed2. Good battery backup, moreover least charging time 50% in less than 25 minutes3. Good camera, specially nightmode and normal 4k videos4. Wide amoled screen, superb screen refresh rate, it's becomes a pleasure to watch videos using every mm of the screen since it is notchless5. Oxygen os is just awesome.6. Price - I cannot just praise a phone with these many features and then cry for high price. It is still way cheaper than Samsung Galaxy flagship phonesCons1. Camera in portrait mode isn't that sharp.2. I am not exactly aware of how the liquid cooling system works. Phone got hot a couple of times. But bearable heating.3. The curved screen isn't of any use. So no idea why OP has done this. Though the phone looks premium with it.4. No 3.5 jack. The only genuine complaint I have. I tried hard to find a good quality type c-3.5 mm connector. Otherwise one will always rely on Bluetooth headphones.Overall, a phone worthy of praise and purchase."
62,Highly over priced
63,"It's a great device I have been using it for a month now... believe me it's completely value for money...it's super snappy buttery smooth...yes it's a little heavier than usual...and battery life is not that good but why complain when u have warp charge it charges you device hell fast...and honestly u will get 24 hours of average battery life...it's great for gaming no heating issue pubg runs at highest graphics...and believe me 90hz refresh rate makes the gaming scrolling supper smooth...the display is great I'd say it's one of the best in the business üòÅ...AND PEOPLE U WON'T GET EARPHONES AND CAR WARP CHARGER WITH THIS AS SHOWN IN YOUTUBE THOSE ARE CREATOR'S BOX THEY ARE ONLY SENT TO BIG CONTENT CREATORS...yes they should have provided a 3.5mm to USB c connector but I bought a OnePlus bullet wired and it's fine u can also buy 3.5mm to USB c convertor from OnePlus official site it costs around 400rs...the fingerprint reader works great..THE CAMERA QUALITY WAS NOT GOOD AT 1ST BUT AFTER 2 UPDATES ITS GREAT...ITS ALSO SPLASH RESISTANT... maximum people are reviewing this after 2-3 days of use but the phone deserves 4 stars....watch YouTube reviewers like MKBHD, Dev2d, unbox therepy...AND OXYGEN OS IS CLOSE TO STOCK ANDROID AND NO BLOATWARE IS LOADED IT WILL WORKTHE SAME SNAPPY AND SMOOTH EVEN AFTER 2-5 YEARS...the pop up camera has free fall detection which is great it closes once the phone slips from your hand...it's has UFS 3.0 storage the first in the world which makes it faster than all the phones and games also load super fast...it also contains first FLUID AMOLED DISPLAY...JUST BUY IT... IT'S GREAT PHONE.. THANK YOU"
64,"I'm using this phone since past 3 days. So, here goes:1. Great display. The curved edges and no-notch display is a great head turner. The large screen makes browsing a great experience.2. Smooth UI. No bloatware whatsoever. No nagging notifications. Very smooth and highly customizable UI.3. Decent Camera. I am not much of a shutterbug. But the snaps I clicked were fantastic. Maybe photography enthusiasts will be able to give a better review on this aspect.4. Nice battery life. Easily lasted 1 and a half day with full charge. And the warp charge is a beaut.5. A little heavy. But we can get used to it."

66,24x7 mobile is very hot.cant even hold in handAlso battery dries very fast
67,"1st biggest problem- FINGER PRINT SCANNER - my friend can open this phone by using his finger print with registering his fingerprint in this phone ...not even one time..more than 10 times he opened infornt of me...which is unexpected...we are using our finger print for all type of transaction....this type of security glith is not acceptable from oneplus(flagship killer).2nd issue- 90HZ DISPLAY- not worth...display flickers sometime after changing to 90hz...in this 8 days more than 15 times i faced hanging/lagging  issue.3rd issue- AUTO BRIGHTNESS  is not at all working properly.4th issue- this type of CAMERA u can get in 15k phones.5th issue- SCRREN GUARD- After paying 53k ,i didnt expect this type of screen guard...in 2 days,it came out.PHONE IS SO BIG AND HEAVY....53K Iz too much for this type of family."
68,"Amazing phone with lots of improvement over 6t.. definitely a worthy purchase.. also i loved the wide angle camera a lot,although camera needs an improvement..amazing display and 90hz refresh rate is so damn smooth and screen quality is so damn good easily comparable with Samsung s10..overall i loved that feel and smoothness..I Love you one plus.. üíì"
69,"The purchase and delivery was excellentNow about product, the camera is awesome, the performance is great..I haven't used any other night end phone like Samsung and iphone to compare this with those. But I like the OnePlus phone so far"
70,*SUPER ATTRACTIVE DISION*BOTH CAMERAS ARE SUPER*BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD*DELIVERY IS TOO LATE*BUT 1+  GIVE NO AUDIO JACK . THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTED FOR ME*AUDIO QUALITY IS SUPER
71,Display problem. After bought within one week
72,"Very first 30 minutes of using the mobile phone (Unboxed it), It started heating up, temperature went up to 43 Degrees,Battery started draining, GPS didn't pick the location. Later fingerprint sensor was responding... I have to use the phone pin to unblock.Even visited the service center in Banjara Hills, And they told me to recreate the scene, Due to heat I have switch off the device, Fear of It might explode. Later they said to use for another day and visit again. Device still heating up.. same issues, Didn't expect this from a flagship phone with a heavy price....Contacting amazon to return the device"
73,"""FLAGSHIP KILLER TO FLAGSHIP""UPDATE: Editing the review after using for more than 6 months, haven't faced any performance issue so far. Performance is top notch till date & now same device getting sold at 10k discount, so it's good buy.----------------------------Planning to buy OnePlus 7 Pro? Here's all in one review:Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few days.Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.PRO'S:- OnePlus 7 Pro's DISPLAY looks damn beautiful üòç with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.- Cam2api enabled.- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.CON'S:- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.- Overpriced.- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can't even focus on near objects.- Device is heavy.- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally üòõ.- No wireless charging.- No headphone.FINAL VERDICT:- If OnePlus 7 Pro satisfies your requirement, buy it though it's little bit overpriced but still worth it.- If not 7 Pro, Samsung S10+ is also great choice.- Otherwise, if looking for low price phone, Flagship Killer 2.0 coming soon üòúNote: I'll update review, after using for few days."
74,On the first day I am facing issue in setting and it's not opening having issue in WiFi connectivity...any more issue...
75,"Good phone. But after paying 52k we expect least a headphones. Ggwp OnePlus. On YouTube while unboxing. They get Bluetooth headphones, car charger, 3 different covers. Really disappointed when I found no headphone in 7pro 8gb RAM 256gb ROM"
76,First of all i am a die hard fan of one plus.I have one plus 5t one plus 6t and now a one plus 7 pro.Seriously very disappointed with the camera.Before one plus i was a mi fan.I have redmi note 3 and note 7.Selfie camera comparison of op 7 n redmi note 7.Redmi note 7 selfie camera is for better than op 7 pro.Op7 pro selfie camera shows ur face like a skin disease patient.Where as op5t and op6t had no issues like this.For this price range op should have included wireless charging.Waiting for a better camera update.
77,The same thing happening in the new replaced phone also I feel disappointed it's not worth for the money. It's hanging a lot in phone application. I am getting irritated when I am try to make a call. I need to wait for 30 to 40 seconds in that to most of the time it closing automatically showing phone is not responding. I didn't expect this from one plus. Totally waste product...
78,I generally use Apple iphone but this time I tried something different. I completely disappointed by using Oneplus 7 pro camera .iPhone 6 camera is more better than this. OIS and EIS is not working properly. There are so many UI issues as well in Oxygen OS.Phone is quite Bulky and not able to handle by using single hand. I wasted 53k to buy this phone. I never buy any product of OnePlus in future.
79,"What a gem of a smart device! Absolutely incredible.Bit heavy, and SD 855 keeps rolling as it reduces battery drainage unbelievably, i didn't expect that.And look at the price, Oh ho man...! it helps us saving atleast 20k, you know what i mean...üòâ"
80,"Heating as hell, poor battery backup. Camera is not good. And it's heavy. Don't feel effect of Dolby Atmos.Pro- just it's screen.I will update after further usage.Update after 1 week, heating issue gone. Facing WhatsApp and YouTube application's frequent crash. Camera quality is still an issue, it's good but not up to the mark of flagship.Update- pro-1. fingerprint sensor + face unlock is fast.2. night camera is really good3. video recording is stable.con-1. During calls there is a whistling sound.2. sometimes touch is not working properly in whatsapp,vlc, youtube, asphalt 8 etc.3. selfie camera is not upto mark4. phone is hanging after first update."
81,Everything is best except the thing that one plus hasn't provided headphones with handset..n even cleaning cloth is not there...only one transparent cover case is available..phone doesn't have headphones jack n hence it should have provided headphones..mine is mirror Black..
82,Do watch the video. M very disappointed with the product
83,"Awesome device, and hats off to amazon for such speedy delivery.I ordered it on 16th May 12PM and it got delivered by 17th May 10AMAnd so far I m absolutely loving this device, buttery smooth and blazing fast. But its a bit big, afterall 6.7 inches is quite a number and super slippery if used without the case.And I am awestruck by the speed it charges. üòç"
84,Worth every buck.Finally one plus has involved and presented a better shaped handset.- Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.- Best in class camera.- Better battery life and charging.
85,"Waste of money this time one plus 7 pro heavy weight not disply gud compare to samsung, also inbuilt screen guard getting with bubles and in youtube show wireless headphone and 2 axtra cover with phone but not recived this time really waste of money"
86,This phone has a hanging issue. Nd ur customer care says they can send d technician on 25th. Its like  i hv spent 53000 nd still i cant use a phone.
87,No 4G direct video call!! What a mess! Clearly over priced. Display is stunning. Performance stunning. Average battery backup. Over hiped device as usual!! Worst RAM management! Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.
88,just bought oneplus 7 prowas exploring itsaved both of my thumbs as fingerprint but the phone opened with my right index fingerprintwhat the hell is this
89,"I am giving 1 star for poor camera quality .The camera is bad than my oneplus 3.Its not able to focus correctly and the final image is blurry.I discovered the issue when clicking a pic of a document.The text was not sharp and all and after doing some more testing with 3rd party apps , and going thru Oneplus Forum, found that many people are facing this same issue.Oneplus should fix this issue, else this would be like OP 2"
90,"Bang for buck phone n a rel flagship killerPros:1. Great built quality, which matches with other premium flagships in the market2. Best part is its display. Large 6.7 inch mesmerising oled display, with gorilla 5 glass n notch free design. Beauty to watch3. Loud n crystal clear speakers4. Fast warp charging5. Super fast performance with latest snapdragon 855 processor, faster ROM, n largee RAM optionsCons:1. Little on heavier side to hold at 200 grams2. No 3.5 earphone Jack, USB C to 3.5 adaptor n earphones not provided despite this high price pointBattery will last over a day with moderate use, and at FHD+ it will last even more. Camera is good, if not the best.For this phone, Pros clearly win over the cons. Go for it"
91,"Writing this review after completely understanding this masterpiece. Transforming from IOs to Android was a cakewalk for me thanks to my OnePlus 3T. Even today after almost 3 years of its use I saw no lag issues, no issues with the battery and instant rapid charging which was the really the most important plus point for me.This Version of OnePlus is surely a masterpiece. Be it the speed, the battery backup, rapid WARP charging, Be it the huge screen and yes the premium look makes it a worth buy. It's been 2 days I own it and everyone who looks at it is amazed to see how perfectly everything is compiled to make this masterpiece. The camera is amazing with three modes as described during the launch with an amazing picture quality.  The music with stereo sound and Dolby Atmos  makes it so much full of life..  The only Cons you can find with this device is the absence of Water resistant label. Rest it is BEYOND PERFECTION."
92,"Powerfully conceived and surely is a great upgrade for those replacing a phone after 2+ years. Processor is great, audio is loud and clear. Price is on the higher end but a worthy deal for people intense on email, social media and fast communication. Miss the 3.5mm jack or the in case wired headset but battery and display makes it up. Had it been, wireless charging could have taken this far further but love the warp charging. Fast fingerprint recognition and selfie camera allows decent face recognition. Oneplus has greatly enhanced the Android underneath. Worthy call if you need speed & quality."
93,"Owesome sound by Dolby Atmos üëå, fingerprint sensor is super,fuild amyloid display is mind blowing,back cover perfectly fits.colourful theme is added including black and white themes which is superb.In built screen recorder in good.90hz refresh rate is smooth and fast.coming to draw backs there is no slot for ear phones we have to buy c type cable which connects earphones.and the screen guard doesn't stick at ends were phone curves not a big problem and the price 53k think if your phone is lost then you will be heartbroken I lost my one plus 3t which costs 30k."
94,Mobile body is very sensitive even in two hours got lots of minute scratches while removing the back cover. Which I've got inside the box.Build quality is slightly poor. Was expecting much from oxygen os. But one plus keep normal features like other brands Asus and Huawei. & No any  advanced features which shows its something special.No microphone jack. Everytime needs to carry connector.
95,nothing special except screen
96,"Take awesome phone with decent price tag.Few key featuresAmazing screenGood battery backupSuperfast chargingCurved screen for premium lookHuge storagePopup camera works as promisedScreen clarity is as good as Samsung S10+( with much better contrast)Few concernsBit heavierScreen length is bit much, wont easily fit in pocket*After recent update few issues resolved but camera quality still lacka in some department. Outdoor photo quality is almost at par but indoor photo lacks refinement.Better to try Google cam mod.Software updates will improve camera quality soon.Screen curve is not in comparison with Samsung S10+ ( samsung screen is much sleeker and with better asthetics)Phone is bit bulky not as sleek as previous one plus modelsDefault phone case is not so good, better to buy a new one"
97,"When there is a video call camera pops up while it is ringing, it should have been camera popping up when I accept the call. This put the selfie camera on risk if the phone is in your pocket n it starts ringingCalled up one plus service centre the answer that I got was this would get resolve when there would be a software update but by that time your camera could get affected"
98,"First of All Amazon You might have became the worlds best company but Kindly Focus on your customer service or you will lose thousands of customers just because of your service. Come To mObile.You can see that i have 3 one plus device. I bought One plus 7 pro mirror black 6+128 model.With The use of 10 days.2-3 days normal working i am not a Big fan of Games or Hd videos or like this i just put 30-40 normal productivity apps in the mobile.After 3 days Battery starts drainning i thought with update this issue will be solved but inwas wrong With in 10 days my fingerprint was not working, And On 10 Thday my Phone Was dead. Its not even power on guys ya I said it right.Is this we got in 49000 rupees. This should not be done. Mobile Phone is very overpriced it should have At ‚Çπ40000.Now come to Customer service part,I am calling from Last 10 days to amazon Customer Care they make false promises and just do formality Which they did with me.Finally i sent my mobile on my own courier expemse to company.Thats it kindly save your money And put it on right place"
99,"This phone, as explained quite nicely by the countless reviews, is one of the best in the price range. The camera is VERY good, although it can be improved. The screen is truly the best in the budget. And Amazon's service is, as always, top notch."
100,This is what I am upset for Amazon product I am very irritating about this product what the hell YouTube also not working well
101,Awesome phone... I m giving this feedback after using it 4 days...Pros: Camera quality is awesome... It's rear camera is better than iphone x (I am also using iphone x)...No lag... It's as fast as iPhone x...Battery back up is awesome...Display quality is awesome...Lighting fast charging...Cons: No led notification...No separate headphone jack... Because of it's c type charging point I hv 2 purchase c type port for using any 3.5 mm jack headphone...For this reason I give 4 out of 5...
102,"I am a oneplus fan (previously owned oneplus 2, 5t than 7pro) but this time I must say that OnePlus misguided about the camera, the S10's 16 MP camera produces far more better pictures than 7pro's 48 MP camera in every scenario, really disappointed with this purchase, I should have gone for the S10 instead."
103,I am giving 2 stars just because of battery and screen. As you can see in video oneplus is in overconfident while making this device. They didn‚Äôt even take care of software and camera. I just sold this phone in 10 days just because of camera quality and hanging problem.
104,"It's a oneplus phone and it gives more than what it has promised. The speed, options, video quality and ease of access all leaves you feeling royal.But in addition I loved Amazon service. I had exchanged my old phone for this and it was such a breeze. I faced no issues and was able to get the phone I wanted in record time. It's just 24 hrs since I first ordered the phone on Amazon and it's already set up and working as usual."
105,"This is by far the best Oneplus device to be launched till date. I never had a oneplus device before. After using it for a week I came across these observations :Battery life is superb, and warp charge really packs a punch. Does 45% charge in around 15-18 minutes.Fingerprint reader is lightning fast.Rear cameras will make you forget Dslr. Low light photographers can will find this amazing. Front camera is perfect. The device is a little heavy but flaws are less when compared to other advantages. 90hz refresh rate is a boon. Actually you have to get a hands on experience as words will fall short for this beast. There is no question of lag. PUBG and other games are smooth and well the graphics is on another level with the gaming mode setting. The fluid AMOLED screen is pure joy. There is no audio jack but that's wierd  but if you can shell out 50k for a premium device then you can afford to shell out few extra bucks for a Bluetooth headset. Still going through the device features as everyday I am coming across new features which is really cool. Mirror grey looks better those who can't buy the nebula blue, go for mirror grey, you won't be disappointed.Overall the device is a beast. Go for it."
106,"Friends ordered this phone and received in just 2 days time. Very much happy with the purchase. Heard a lot of negative complaints like camera, phantom touch, slow fingerprint etc. Which phone haven't has that. But this one really lived up to my expectations. The issues with this phone will definitely go away with updates, I received the first update and there is development in camera quality. I haven't had any experience of phantom touch and poor fingerprint yet. The display is very punchy and accurate. OnePlus development team is very active and will provide all updates to optimise this phone..so go for it."
107,One plus put a lot of effort while designing the phone itself it's a beautiful peice of technology. Feels premium! The screen is just irresistible it's just wow. With QuadHD panel with 90hz refresh rate it's the best in the market now. One plus did well with the cameras this time. The main sensor the 48MP one is good after the update. But the wide angle suffers a bit in low light plus 3x zoom lens performance lies between the main sensor and wide angle. The portrait comes great out of the device. The selfie cam is good but seems to get harder on face in WhatsApp cam. The battery backup is okay considering the fact the phone has qhd screen with 90hz refresh rate. Yes we can change that for sure. The haptic feedback is just wow much better that previous models. The finger print reader is fast sometimes inaccurate but yes it's good. Oxygen OS doesn't need any explanation it's just buttery smooth. Thanks to the SD 855 and 8GB ram on my phone plus the UFS 3.0 storage throw any app on the device it will hadle it without a sweat multitasking is top notch on this set. But seriously one plus just had me on the screen and design....!
108,"Very good and excellent using From past two days received on 17th of may , no issues with phone battery backup Good no heating, refresh rate too fastValue for MoneyPop up Selfie Camera is Great.Battery Life is Pretty Good.Music Sound System is Very Good.Inprint Finger sensor is Fast and good to unlock the phone"
109,"Really an amazing phone.You will fall for the screen itself.Bought on amazon prime sale on 16th and got it on 17th. Super fast delivery by amazon. kudos.Coming it the phone, it came with the pre-applied screen protector and a transparent case. That's a good welcome gesture. This is my first OnePlus phone coming from a stock android phone. The OOS is clutter free and experience is pure smooth with 90Hz and QHD+ resolution. With that in mind, the SOT of the phone with full brightness will  hardly reach 5 Hours. I use this preset in home as, thanks to warp charge, which charges in 1 Hr 10 min from 0 %. And when I go to office or any other, I use the FHD+ and 60Hz preset to get almost ~8 hours SOT with medium to high brightness.Basically this is a gaming phone. So you can play PUBG with no lag at all, also maxed out settings in Call of Duty Mobile.Camera quality is very promising. I used Gcam to get almost as good as pixel like shots. Day light shots in stock cam is better than GCam. Except for the consistency across the cameras. I hope OP will fix this issue with an update.Finally I would say that, this mobile is totally worth it for the price you pay."
110,"I had been using my OnePlus 3T since December 2016. The device was still good enough for my daily necessities but the battery life dropped down to a considerable extent so I decided to get the OnePlus 7 Pro. My expectations were quite high, and guess what? This phone gracefully rose past all of them. Here is my review after three weeks of usage. Trust me, I've used the stuffing out of the device in these three weeks.Desirable features :1. Display : Arguably the phone's strongest selling point. My mind was shuttling between the 7T and 7 Pro and the display is what sold by. Beautiful Quad HD curved display with 90 Hz refresh rate. Curved displays may not be for everyone, but I've condoned them since the s6 edge and hence, I personally love it. Accidental touches are also very rare (I do have fat fingers). As for the refresh rate, it improves the overall user experience and if you don't believe me, keep a phone with a 60 Hz screen next to this and you will definitely observe the difference. The screen is pretty bright and has legit outdoor visibility as well. Night and reading modes also ensure you have a pleasant experience using it in the dark. Screen flickering is not noticeable for the average user but you have the DC dimming option as well if in case you do notice it.2. Software optimization : Oxygen OS is OnePlus' forte. Undisputedly the best OS available for android. It is buttery smooth and packed with just the right amount of features. I didn't feel the need for a third party launcher. Rest assured, you will definitely receive regular software updates for three years at least.3. Performance : Moving from the 3T, this felt like riding a H2R after owning a splendour all my life. I haven't noticed any lags or stutters no matter what task I threw at it. As for gaming, I've saved it for the end of the review. PUBG lovers do check out the bottom of the review for a detailed PUBG review. Spoiler alert : it outperforms even some of the gaming phones on the market today.4. Audio output : The dual stereo speakers are very loud. The clarity is excellent for listening to media and taking calls as well. Dolby Atmos is the cherry on top of the cake.5. Camera : Many reviews said that the camera was a disappointment. Well, OnePlus seems to have fixed it with numerous updates because when I got my device and installed all the updates, the camera performance was splendid. Pro mode allows you to tweak the settings considerably. Slow motion videos are good too, though not the best. Any normal user would be very happy with the camera as I had no complaints. it doesn't beauty or oversaturate images. Initially, when I opened slow motion at night in indoor lighting, the screen was flickering and so did the resulting video. But it turns out it is not a manufacturing defect. The sensor cannot shoot slow motion videos on certain lighting conditions. But it works well in outdoor lighting. So if you try it for the first time indoors, do not freak out if this happens. Video recording at 4k;60fps is awesome too.TIP : Use Pro mode to click RAW images and then edit them on Snapseed. RAW files produce excellent details but also range from 20-30 MB per image. They are a little soft but Snapseed is all you need to edit the images.6. Network reception : Network reception and Wi-Fi speed is also much better. Internet speed is much better on this phone as compared to my older devices (3T and Mi A2 lite).7. Warp charging : It charges from 0 to 100 in just about an hour's time. And the best part is, the phone doesn't heat up at all. Only the adapter gets warm, but the phone doesn't heat up despite the charging speed.8. Design - The phone looks beautiful and feels premium. The notchless display is a treat to the eyes. I have the nebula blue variant and the frosted glass back looks magnificent. It feels great to hold and even better to behold.Well, this phone does everything you expect from a phone perfectly. So the pros list would go on and on.Could be better :Battery life - OnePlus packs a 4000 maH battery. It will easily last you through the day even if you are a heavy user. I get 6-7 hours of screen on time normally and a little over 5 hours if I do a lot of gaming and YouTube. I have my display set at 9 Hz and 1440p resolution so this does pull a lot off the battery. But considering the size and weight of this phone, OnePlus could have provided us with a battery. I did try setting the screen to 60 Hz and 1080p and it improved the battery life by roughly 15-20%, but what's the point of having such a powerful display and not being able to exploit it to the fullest?Liabilities :1. No headphone jack - When I buy a premium phone, I expect the company to at least pack a type C to 3.5mm adapter, if not a type C headphones. Come on, even apple gives you compatible earphones in the box. I spent an extra 390 bucks for the adapter. It works fine but would have been better if it came in the box.2. Tempered glass - OnePlus gives you an applied screen protector with the phone and it is good, but it is not shatterproof. When you have an expensive display, it is always better to secure it with a good tempered glass. But finding a good one is a pain. Either it has black edges, doesn't cover the screen completely, or the application process is a hassle and error prone. And they cost at least four times the amount for flat screen phones. Have ordered one from glazedinc, let's hope it fits the bill.A few perks :To make the phone look better, I downloaded wallpapers from unsplash. I also installed the flight icon pack (free version). You don't need a separate launcher for it, Oxygen OS allows you to use icon packs and it is quite simple. You can customize the icons and even change the name of the apps(useful if you want to be shady).Also installed an edge screen app. Have attached a screenshot of my home screen. Also, enable dark mode. The display makes it beautiful.Set animation scale in developer options to 0.5x for an even snappier experience.I suggest you use the fingerprint scanner and avoid face unlock as the front camera has to pop up Everytime you need to unlock your phone. Besides it is very accurate and fast too. I've disabled finger unlock animation so make it seem faster (perception hack).Verdict :I have the 8GB RAM/256GB ROM version.  It is worth the 43 grand damage. Given a second chance, I'd still pick the same phone again and I am sure you would too. After all, it won the MVP award in MKBHD's smartphone awards 2019. :)PUBG Mobile review :This is an absolute beast of a phone for PUBGM. Default settings itself was set to HDR + Extreme and it handled it very well. Constant 60 fps was achieved with minor drops to 58 and never below that. I personally prefer to play at Smooth + Extreme as bullets register the fastest in these settings (as said by professional players). I'm a four finger claw + full gyroscope player. I picked up full gyro practicing for just two weeks in this phone. Touch response is super quick and there are no multi touch issues. Gyro response is also perfect and I play with the same sensitivity as Snax. My gameplay has improved a lot with this phone. Curved display wasn't an issue for me at all. You also have an in built screen recorder that records both internal and external audio. Recording your gameplay doesn't affect the performance at all. Minor heating is noticeable after two classic matches if you're recording. 5 minutes of recording at 60fps will consume close to 1GB of your storage. I can game for around 4-4.5 hours when the phone is fully charged. There is no thermal throttling and phone's performance does not drop at all. Besides, the notchless screen improves.yoir gaming experience and haptic feedback is excellent too. If you're looking for an amazing gaming performance as a bonus, this is the phone for you. The frame rate is even more consistent than ROG phone 2, second maybe only to iPhones."
111,"Super bad... Extremely disappointing camera, bad fingerprint sensor, not worth the money"
112,The display is amazing and it just grows on you. You can never use any other handset after using this display.Battery is good for 1 and half day usage but the wrap charge is dope.Weight is a bit heavy and big screen but big phones are the call of the day so can't complain much.Design is so attractive and feels can never be backdated even after using this for 2 years.Camera specs are awesome and software is good bit with time it will improve more I am sure. Don't get me wrong it gets decent pictures and great selfies.
113,Works like a charm little hefty but butter smooth.And for people talking about incomplete product delivery what you see on youtube is reviewers unit jot retail unit so stop with the dumb comments.My only complaint is that there is no headphone in the box and nor did the company provide the adaptor for the same
114,"I'm upgrading from the one plus 2 and this phone is beyond what I expected of it. It's fast! The 90hrz display is butter smooth media consumption is a breeze thanks to the bezelsless display and the Dolby speakers which are loud and clear even outside. The performance is simply the best! No issues here whatsoever. Battery life could've been a bit better but it's completely acceptable due to the fact that it's powering a Mammoth of a screen. I'm close to getting 6.5 hrs of screen-on time and can get through a day with 10% at the end of the day with my usage. Camera is great it may not be as impressive as the pixel but it comes damn close I hope this will improve over time with software updates. If you're confused about picking this or the standard one plus 7 let me tell you I was too in that spot. But took the plunge and got the 7pro and after using it for over a week let me tell you the extra you spend on it is absolutely worth it the screen alone is enough to blow your doubts away. Unless you're strapped for cash consider getting the 7pro its worth it.Summing up:Pros1)Screen2)Dolby speakers3)Performance4)Price (still cheaper than other flagships)5)Premium Build.Cons1)Battery (Although acceptable for me, heavy users might find it lacking.)2)No Headphone jack or headphones provided. (shockingly no converter provided either.)3) camera (don't get me wrong it's perfectly good enough for average people and not a deal breaker but it's just not as good as the pixel.)"
115,"It's a beautiful beast. Screen is the best . No notch and no hole , the view is clear and you enjoy it. Oxygen Os is always like a stock android which is the best. Camera is okay. But yes I think they should have added type c 3.5 mm converter out of the box in such price segment."
116,The first thing firstThe design is awesome.Specs are awesomeAnd almost near to stock android is also awesome.This mobile is just super fast.I think spending 50k + on this is better than spending on Samsung items.
117,"Awesome product from one plus and comes to camera quality, it has improved alot after the software update (OS 9.5.7)Only thing i felt personally as a con for this mobile is its huge 6.67 inch display which is a bit tricky to handel.Battery life is very good and lasts for minimum 24 hrs if you are using it for quite a bit heavy as well.I would suggest this mobile if you are fine and can cross over your budget."
118,"I'll go through all points what's good, what's bad and what oneplus could've done better.THE GOOD-very good in gaming-very beautiful design to look at-very good & optimized software-very future proof-no overheating, throttling, etc-very good speakers (both clarity & loudness)THE BADPoor Screen protectorpre-applied screen protector is of very poor quality. It gets scratches sitting in my pocket within few days of use. I'm not sure it'll survive even a month and btw I am a person who take extreme care of my devices.Warp ChargerIt's very fast but phone feels slightly warm from back as well as front side while charging. i tried dash charger and there was no such problem. So, I am sticking with dash most times.Provided Covercover is ok. it's a bit on thicker size but not as thick as my 6t but ulike 6t dust, etc can get in this cover which is very annoying as I have to constantly clean it.Fanatic modeIt's not practical to use it as it blocks all calls, notifications, etc and don't even give us option to turn some of these things off. Gaming mode is fineA bit overpricedRobert Downy Jr, Amitabh Bhacchan, and other big stars are promoting this device and it looks like we're paying price for those big names as this device is not 14,000 different from regular oneplus 7IN-BETWEEN GOOD & BADCameraBack camera is hit or miss, sometimes it click very sharp and detailed photos but other-times it's photos are little on softer side and sometimes I felt that there's some beautification going on. But overall it gets the job done.Battery lifewith 90hz and QHD+ on battery life is average but with 60hz and FHD+ it's pretty even slightly better than my 6t, still battery life can be improved.About the sizeAlthough I prefer small phones and this is sure not a small one. It's very bulky but handling is ok you'll get use to it"
119,"I have been using this phone from more than a week now. Here are the things I liked and disliked:# Display is Great (but its glamour goes away after putting on a back cover, which is necessary as the phone is too slippery without it üôÅ)# Camera is not that great if we see it from the price point. I was using OnePlus 5T before this and i feel i had a better camera setup. Also, I don't know why nobody is talking about the Portrait mode of the rear camera, it automatically zooms the image 3x, making it hard to take portraits of a nearby people/objects. Also, zooming 3x makes things very shaky and hard to take a steady shot. Really not satisfied with the Portrait mode's auto cropping zoom. Similar issue was there in OnePlus 5, the first OP phone having a dual camera setup, but the issue was resolved in 5T.# The next big thing that no one is talking about in the reviews is unavailability of Notification LED. This is seriously a big turn off for me.# Battery backup is decent considering the screen size and display quality.# The phone is too slippery without a cover. The phone attracts a lot of dirt and is also a fingerprint magnet.# The company should have provided a better back cover and Type C earphones (or at-least the Type C to 3.5mm jack converter) within the box at this price.# I also purchased the OnePlus Wireless Bullets 2 separately. Their sound quality it's good but there is no sound feedback received (the connecting beep sound that you get after long pressing the button) while using Google Assistant via the button on wireless bullets. Even my wired earphones provide that feature.Overall its a good phone if camera is not a great deal for you. Though the OnePlus should have kept the starting price of this phone under 40k. Instead of wasting money on advertisement and making big celebrities their brand ambassadors, the company should stick to their original vision of providing flagship killer features at an even killer Price tag."
120,"Very bad service, Device started flickering after 20 days of purchase yet it was working for more then 10 days before it stopped all of a sudden, 100% Sure and gurantee that device was never ever close to any liquid, but then too service people said that device has water damage and I have to pay 17000 rs for replacing display.Pathetic and cheap style of earning more money like you earn in all different colour modules.Before I was proud to show my ohone to other people, now I got why iphones are better deal.50,000 is very hard to earn for a middle class person, I waited for this phone and buyed this phone by collecting 5000 every month from my salary of 25,000.I know phone is good, but the servie they offer is worst."
121,"My previously used few mobiles - Galaxy S7,S8,Note 8,Note 9....This time i have decided to go with one plus for first time, and belive me,it was a fantastic decesion.Previously i am avoiding other mobile brands ,only for displays.But this time one plus hitted a bulls-eye.Thanks to great display.I am amongst first few members to buy this master piece,as soon as it has launched and i have taken full 20 days to evaluate this mobile to write this review.As promised,delivery of mobile was superquick by Amazon.I have received this mobile,even before it was released for regular customers,and available on retail outlets.Thanks to Amazon.This mobile is overall a very good package. Display of this mobile is fantastic,with crisp and clear pictures.Though samsung displays are little bit superior,but margin is very narrow and for day today work,margin is absolutely nil.This displays donot oversaturate the images and pictures.Battery life is fantastic and last for entire day easily with heavy use on 60 hz QHD setting.On 90 hz it is little less.Battery life is definately far far better compaired to my Note 9.Camera quality needs some improvements, but i am sure that one plus will definately rectify it in upcoming updates.Already,a update from one plus has improved camera performance drastically.Mobile is little overweight and big to handle for average sized hand people,but it is matter of just getting ""used to it"".Once you get used to it,you will definately enjoy using this mobile and watching movies on it.Sound quality is crispy clear and battery backup is also very good,even if you use blutooth headsets.Fingerprint reader is fast but still needs some improvement...SD 855 Processor is superfast.No need to review it,as this is fastest amongst all mobiles,i have used in past.UI is very good,and you can adjust it according to your needs.WRAP charging is fantastic.You will get decent battery charge within 15 min of charging this mobile in emergency situations,though it will not be required in day today practice,as battery backup is fantastic for mod-heavy users,as stated earlier.I my opinion,compairing price to performance ratio,this moble is the best mobile to buy to date.So ""JUST GO FOR IT"".Now ,I became a proud fan of one plus."
122,"This is a review after a month usage:Pros:Display- 5+/5Camera 4.5/5Touch-4.7/5Battery-4/5Fast changing- 5+/5üòúFingerprint sensor: 5Now coming to the in-depth review, first thing was the Display: Which I noticed when I opened the package and switched on the phone was the built in wallpaper animation and that's when I immediately noticed the 90 hz fluid AMOLED display's awesomeness üòçüòç. Then the next time was while playing pubg, it's graphics was simply awesomeüòç. Then again the third time I fell in love was during the display setting when we can manually tune the display colours. And I really longed for a curved edge display phone for a long time and all these features put together felt awesome.Camera: At first, I was very sceptic about it as there were bad reviews swarming around cameraüòÖ. Then immediately the phone was demanding me to update it which I eventually did , which was around 2 gb. And then I took a few picture in artificial lighting with fingers crossed but it was fine. Then post that I thought the camera was not up to the marküòµ. But to my surprise it was me who was the culprit üòú and this came to light when I took some pictures during daylight, also I'm new to the triple camera setup so I was the one to be blamed for and not the phone, then as I got a hold of it the, picture quality was getting better and better üòç. So now I can say it has a pretty decent quality üòâ though it's not in comparison with other flagships out there I'm really happy with it's images also the 3x zoom feature will shock you as there is no loss in the image quality. Portrait mode is awesome but you will have to get used to it, selfie camera is also awesome, which also gives you awesome images üòç. Gaming: I'm not s hard core gamer at least in Mobile , since this device has pretty hardware built for games I thought of giving it a try, and to my surprise I fell for it at the login screen as the animations were so pleasing to the eyes üòç and during the game play there was no frame drops and the gameplay was pretty smooth üëçBattery: since it's a heavy 4k mAh battery I thought it would last for a more than a day on heavy usage, but it's not so coz of increased resolution and refresh rate, it drains the battery a lot especially during heavy usage, but if we are not using it much the battery easily lasts for 1.5 days, plus the Warp charging, just shatters your perspective about charging, coz it charges three device  from 10-100 in shy of 80 mins which is mind blowing.Finger print scanner is one of the plus for this device coz it's blazingly fast when compared to it's competitors üëçüòçOxygen Os: I'm a first time user and to me this interface is just as smooth as butter, the feel, the response,90hz refresh rate, vibrant Display all together is simply awesome. No lags so far. Will update this in coming months.Only con was the ear phone jack , but that can be resolved using a USB c to 3.5 converters , I used ptron adapter which is amazing and you can also charge and connect to earphones at the same time üòÖ.I guess that's it for now will update on near future, if you're planning to buy this you can blindly go for it and won't regret üëç"

124,"I use 4 finger claw for Pubg and at random times the screen glitches for no particular reason. There are glitches of different type:1. Sometimes the place where my buttons are on screen, they get clicked even when my fingers are no where near it.2. Sometimes I have to have a finger tapping on the middle of the screen otherwise the buttons at the top left edges wont activate no matter how many times I tap.3. Sometimes buttons wont work all together.All these glitches happen at random. Sometimes the phone will be working fine and other times it just goes to hell. So playing competitive for which I bought such an expensive phone is defeated.Pros:Camera.Dunno, failed almost all my expectations.Cons:Pop up camera.Refer Pros.With no apps running in background and only wifi on 24x7 and no one using the phone, the battery last 2-2.5 days...with no usage. If you are using the phone with something like wifi or data or location (any one, never-mind two of these) on at all times, you are looking at at least one time charging the phone at eveningSincerely Disappointed,One plus user."
125,"I was so confused in between S10+ and OP7 Pro because i was worried about weight and camera but both are excellent. I am glad that i opted OnePlus7 Pro. The moment i turned on the display i was simply amazed by its quality, seriously it's just pleasure to eyes to watch and feel this display.Other than this performance, camera, OS, and premium look of Nebula blue all are just amazing.Go for it and trust me you not gonna regret it."
126,"""WHICH PHONE SHOULD I BUY?"" Will be the common question of everyone today who are planning for the premium smartphone, especially with Snapdragon 855 Chipset.I think many of them have already written a detailed review of this product, OnePlus 7 Pro. But in this review, I want to focus on one issue of the current people, ""WHICH PREMIUM PHONE SHOULD I BUY?""Because earlier, it was a very easy task to judge the best, flagship, worthy premium smartphone - OnePlus. But now, it appears very difficult to select the best flagship smartphone. Because now we have so many options like S10, Note 10, K20, etc. to select. And even I was totally confused. But after buying and researching many premium phones, I am concluding things in this review.So now let us start to compare almost each and every premium smartphone with this OnePlus 7 Pro smartphone so that it will be helpful for you to buy the right smartphone.1) Samsung Note 10: Priced at 70000, less battery capacity, less powerful processor, smaller screen, no 90-hertz screen smoothness, no Quad-HD. So here OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner. You can choose this Samsung Note 10, only if your preference is a compact smartphone with S-Pen. Or else, please buy OnePlus 7 Pro itself.2) Samsung Note 10 Plus: Priced at 80000 (oh my God), performs less powerfully with Exynos chipset when compared to OnePlus 7 Pro's Snapdragon 855 processor. I don't know why Samsung doesn't provide Snapdragon chipsets for few countries for S series premium smartphones, even after charging 80k. And still same display - no 90-hertz smooth screen. And one more funniest thing, no 100% display. I mean, still, they are providing punch-hole selfie camera on the main display, whereas pop-up selfies are provided by other brands at just Rs.15,000 now. Come on Samsung! Even after charging 80,000, no pop-up camera? Kidding? So according to me, here also the clear winner is OnePlus 7 Pro. If your preference is S-Pen alone with the latest premium smartphone from Samsung brand, please go for this and pour your hard-earned money.3) Redmi K20 Pro: I have used this. By paying 33k you will be hit continuously by MI dirty ads, for a poor quality AMOLED display. I hated this. No way match even for OnePlus 7. I can clearly tell that this can't even beat OnePlus older smartphones. Xiaomi should realize that customers are paying money for what they are providing. Earlier the scenario was different. Only MI smartphones were very much budget-friendly and ads were accepted (that too by some people). But now, showing ads is like totally killing themselves. OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner here too. And I really don't see any good reasons why people should opt for Xiaomi phones anymore. Until they stop ads and spoil kids, I don't recommend MI phones to anyone anymore.4) Oppo Reno: I have used this too. Earlier I used to think that all AMOLED screens will be great. Because earlier, there were just Samsung and OnePlus to provide commonly AMOLED screens. But I learned from Redmi K20 and Oppo guys, that all AMOLED screens are not the same. These screens can never match even Samsung's entry-level smartphones' AMOLED display nor they can match OnePlus older versions' AMOLED displays. And moreover, what I really hated much was ColourOS UI of Oppo. My god! It is horrible I felt. According to me, here also OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner though Reno also uses Snapdragon 855 processor. Choose this only if your preference is high zooming of your rear-camera. Because Oppo Reno has 10x zoom while OnePlus 7 Pro's has just 3x camera zoom.5) Black Shark 2: In this 100% display era, MI, along with popping ads, is again lacking to provide the full display. This is a smartphone of having infinity display like OnePlus 5T or Samsung S8 and S9 series. So here also the clear winner is OnePlus 7 Pro. Again, I don't see any good reasons to go for this smartphone.6) Asus 6z: This smartphone has failed to provide the AMOLED display in spite of being categorized as a premium phone. Very surprising. This itself enough to lose the competition I guess and OnePlus 7 Pro is the clear winner here too. If the price is the only criteria, one can choose this unique revolving camera smartphone.7) Samsung S10: Again, I don't think it is good to pay a huge amount (61,900) for a smartphone with no 100% display in this era. So the winner here also is OnePlus 7 Pro. If a compact powerful phone is what you want, one can go for this.8) Samsung S10 Plus: Same goes here. My god...Samsung's pricings are too much I feel when compared to OnePlus 7 Pro. So the winner here also is OnePlus 7 Pro. If superb camera quality is the only needed factor, one can go for this Samsung S10 Plus.9) Huawei P30 Pro: It is a known fact that Huawei and its sibling Honor was banned by the US for spying. And Android itself was expected to be killed on these phones. Though the ban is lifted for time being, it is not certain that the ban-lift will be permanent or temporary. So why should one risk in investing a huge amount on this brand? So I feel time waste in researching these brand's smartphones. So I prefer OnePlus 7 Pro only here also.10) Honor View 20: Same 9th point goes here.11) Huawei Mate 20 Pro: Same 9th point goes here.12) Google Pixels: Again, the Samsung theory goes here. When the era is of 100% displays, punch-hole cameras, infinity displays, notch displays, waterdrop displays, etc. are all meaningless I feel. So my choice is OnePlus 7 Pro without any doubts.So after researching and trying everything, I strongly feel that currently, OnePlus 7 Pro is the only model which can be trusted and you get more than what you pay.Frankly speaking, initially, when OnePlus launched this 7 Pro smartphone, I was disappointed by considering the price factor and the smartphone's size factor also. But now after using for a few days, that too after trying all other brands, I am really feeling that this OnePlus 7 Pro is worth for every penny you pay. Even the phone is NOT BULKY IF YOU USE A RIGHT SLIM CASE.The display itself mind-blowing and everything provided in the package is very, very powerful. All the three colors are beautiful - mirror grey, almond white, and nebula blue. Chose whichever you want. And feel free to submit questions to me. I will try to answer."
127,I have buy this phone on the first when it come on amazon for sale. but after comparing this oneplus 7 pro camera with old oneplus 6 and oneplus 6t they have much batter camera then this op7 pro. but they are avalabile in 32999/- and i have spent 53000/- almost 20000 for this phone but i am not happy with this phone camera.i cant return this product because i have purchase this phone on bajaj emi. but now i am feeling cheated by oneplus india.
128,"First of all i m using ONE PLUS for the first time. The phone performance is mind blowing, no lag nothing at all.üñ•Ô∏èThe Display is so awesome, u will fall in love with it. üòçüòçüì∑ Camera is gud bt still it requires improvement in my viewüîã Battery is Good, i think due to big screen it consume battery a little faster, bt after updates it will be fixed definitely..üéÆGame lover Go for it no doubt..And dont think for negative review. I dont knw why people are so stupid.. üòÇ"
129,Never buy this product or anything from oneplus within 8 days this phone is not working because of just little rain and now company is asking me to pay 41000 to repair it. The Chinese companies are only to loot Indian people.
130,Everything is ok  but its camera doesn't meet the requirement.. i can't tell its 50k+ device with this rubbish camera quality ..toooooo soft images ..no sharp image and less detail in camera.  Front camera is not usable ..too low quality..Even redmi note 7 pro has more detail than this camera .. this phone made fun of me among my friends in camera department.Fix the camera one plus
131,Phone is good except the feature hyped like Camera and Speed. Picture quality is not so great as expected. Also the finger touch screen do sometime have issue. Last 3 days phone has started hanging / getting freezed for sometime inpite of 12GB RAM and 256GB memory. Miss my SAMSUNG features where the phone can be handled with single hand. Also for calling from second SIM dialing is must to dial from  Primary SIM first and then again from called list can dial from second sim
132,"Review after using the phone after 12 days.Pros:1. Beautiful display without notch/punch hole.2. Easy access to older phone stuff (basically setting up this phone was insanely easy with all the ways offered to sync your data)3. Fingerprint scanner & face unlock is super quick and secure (couple of my friends actually tried to unlock my phone with my photo.. didn't work lol)4. Audio quality from both stereo speakers and earphones in amazing.Cons:1. No 3.5mm jack or even a convertor pin out of the box (which is huge for me, I'm still stranded as there is no stock for the convertor on the official store).2. Phone is massive, just about fits in my jeans pocket.Still working on more points, the above are just from top of my mind"
133,"Honest Review for One Plus 7 Pro :It's my first one plus phone(12GB RAM, 256GB ROM) which I bought 4 months back and I am quite happy with the design and performance of it. I will try to cover most of the positive and negative aspects of the phone.Pros :1. Speed - I have used mobile phone of every company and I must say it has the best performance ever. Apps opened in just fraction of seconds.2. Display - It has been a wonderful experience of using 90 hertz display which makes it more superior than other mobile phone displays.3. Camera - Stability of the camera is very good even you are recording video in moving vechicle.4. Notchless display - One of the coolest feature of this phone is it's full screen display without any notch which gives user an amazing experience.5. Battery - Currently, this phone has a battery back up of one and a half day. Will update it after completing 1 year.6. Fast Charging - It will take your phone to get full charge from 0 to 100 percent in just 1 hour 20 minutes. And in half an hour, it will charge your phone above 50 percent.Cons :1. Quite Heavy - As I have used number of phones I personally find it quite heavy which is due to hardware they have provided. But now I am habitual to it.2. Auto Brightness - Sometimes I feel the auto brightness feature doesn't works well. So in that case I have to manually adjust the brightness. May be oneplus can fix this issue in the upcoming software updates.3. Night mode in camera - Night mode of the camera is not that good as compared to other phones. It could be more better. May be this can also be fixed in next software update.4. Price - Upto OnePlus 6T the price of the phones were nearly 35k. This is the first phone which costs nearly 50k. Quite overpriced but value for money.5. No IP rating - Although company claims that it is water resistant but ip rating must be given by company for such a flagship phone.6. Glass panel - The phone is very slippery if you are using it without cover and back panel can easily break. Therefore, I suggest to have a good case to protect.7. No 3.5 mm jack - You have to compromise with the 3.5 mm audio jack if you want to purchase this phone. I sometimes feel there must be 3.5mm jack but then I use bluetooth earphones.To sum up, although there are number of disadvantages but still this phone is value for money. I hope this review will be helpful."
134,"It's okay okay Phone nothing so much extra ordinary about op7pro in 50 k plus budget. For me i have used Lg v30 plus . I find v30 plus had better features and technologies than this one. V30 plus comes with Wireless charging  ,IP68 rating, quadack headphone jack. In 4gb ram it runs fine i have played PUBG in it for year long and never ever it said restarted . I found divice is beat underrated. If you are planning for same features go for it. Now LG v30 plus comes in 25 k . May be you can plan buy LG V40 plus in latest in OP7PRO budget with better features .Phone start working on itself.Finger sensor works only if you press rightly and tightly fingerprint sensor sucks compare to other flagship phone I will not recommend OP7 Pro.Wasted 50k."
135,"This phone is at its best , no complaints apart from the camera which is a software issue and not a hardware (this can be fixed). . Many have hate comments on this phone but truth be told, they are just mindless people who bought a product without even understanding it... Such mindless people should go for an iphone ü§£ü§£ and pay around 1.5 lakhs... For gamers this phone is a beast !!!!"
136,"This is my personal experience I am sharing. After 10days of purchase,  the phone got hanged during call, and the system didn't work for half an hour,not even power and reboot button. The problem recurred after 1 week.  After investing this big amount for a phone,  this kind of experience really gets you into trouble.Also,  would advice Amazon to extend return timeline and should give 1 month for these kind of products, as these are big investment for the user."
137,"Fingerprint reader: Initially gave me a tough time, but guess the system is used to me nowüòÖ works fine nowCamera: Not so happy about the video quality the images are gudBattery life: A little tweak with the system will help prolong the battery life..And about cons: Show me a mobile which has no cons,personally I am happy and pretty much satisfied with my 7 proü•∞"
138,Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.Best in class camera.Better battery life and charging.Everything is best except the thing that one plus hasn't provided headphones with handset..n even cleaning cloth is not there...only one transparent cover case is available..phone doesn't have headphones jack n hence it should have provided headphones.
139,"I am very much upset at the phones working. I have used one plus  3t, 5,  6, 6t but unfortunately this phone when in landscape mode blank screen is showing.  Being number one e-commerce site has to check in all parameters before despatch as customer buys only on name AMAZON  tag.  The set has to be replaced or repaired at doorstep by One plus. They have to sell genuine products when competitors increase"
140,"This is the first time I have moved away from Samsung as I have heard a lot from one plus users about it. I purchased it on 28th May as soon as Nebula blue was available. Honestly saying, I'm using galaxy notes since the launch of NOTE 1. I NEVER thought of opting out of note series. But believe me I have never used such a beautiful phone in my life. Although I have paid 50k bucks for previous phone.Keeping all pros and cons aside--This phone is A BEAST!! My favorite think about this is-- Warp charge!Com'on NO phone ever charges in less than an hour but it does. Whenever I go for bath it charges almost full and battery draining is not quick even if I stream live matches. Gone are those days when We had to worry about powerbanks charger plugs etc. I don't know about other reviewers, but for me it's totally worthy to spend 50k on this masterpiece."
141,"I brought it 5 days ago and lots of thinking between S10 then gone for this one. Sinse last 6 years I am using Samsung S series and still have my S8 as my secondary backup phone. No doubt the phone is good, fast, speedy, great display. I am not regret as its best value for money when hardware, performance and price considered. All these below points are just I dont like, there are lots of other things which I like as well.1. The phone is heavy and big. 207gram feels like a brick. If you fill-up a phone with features but still form factor is not practical use then this is a fail. UFS 3.0 storage only have write speed of 229MB/S, this is lower than some phones with UFS2.1 example: S10. The phone design is common and looks just like other Mi, Vivo Oppo phones. No X factor. In my view its a premium Chinese phone.2. Camera is a myth. Sony IMX586 is a failed and over hiped sensor in its era. Now a days used in mid range Chinese phones. I wish OnePlus should have skipped this one. If camera in a phone is your primary requirement then keep away from this. I love photography and have my DSLR for that so I dont trust any phone camera or that was not a concern for me. I have tested in all conditions and sorry to say this is a bad camera for a flagship. Front camera is good enough and I like it including its design. I recommed that please turn of scene recognition, auto HDR in camera settings menu to click at least some good pictures in day light. For night or dark light camara is good I believe. I assumed that the developer team put their entire efforts to bring a camera which can provide good photos in night and forget that we take most of the photos in day light. So those night calibrated auto settings will ruin your daylight photos. But still even if you try to get best shots, its far behind Apple and Samsung Cameras.3. Oxygen OS is good and fast I am using 1st time, but it doesn't have native apps like Email Client, Music Player, Payment App, Security App, Calendar, Contact, Phone Call and so many others. For all these it's depending on stock Android. Now you say whats a big deal? Apps are available in playstore for free to download. But I think those free application are comes with lots of advertisements, notification and even Google native apps track you for their add selling. I use yahoo mail, why I will pay yahoo 350 rupees monthly to use their email client. Another thing I noticed that Home bar doesn't auto hide during keyboard popup so I accidentally click the home key many times during type and suddenly go to home screen. That is a big drawback. The home bar should be hide during type. OnePlus please look that simple but very useful stuff.Rest assured, I also agree with others that its an insanely fast phone. Battery is best in class as per my use. This is a good phone and would be best if Oneplus taken care of some useful requirements. A great Display and good hardware will not certify a phone as a flagship. There are lots of other aspects need to be considered. This phone doesn't fulfilled my criteria of a flagship however personal choices may be different by individuals."
142,"Had the 6t before this and wanted to check this phone out for it's 90 hz display and QHD+ resolution. It turns out the hype is real and once you start using this display, it's hard to use the one on the 6t or any other phone (60 hz I believe). You can actually tell the difference.The all-screen no-notch display is excellent and with 516 ppi, the display is very sharp and the performance is super fast. (I got the 12/256 version).Although you can turn the display back to output 60hz, you'll get so used to the 90hz that you'll have a hard time adjusting.Got it on the Diwali offer on Amazon with quick and damage-free delivery.Don't really use the selfie camera much on any phone, so can't really comment on that. But it does help that it's hidden on top so that you get a notch-free display. Can't comment on the back camera either as I'm not really a big photo-taking person.Should you get the 7t Pro instead of this? It depends, if you just want the McLaren edition or the 855+ chipset. Otherwise, this is an amazing option as it released just four months before and at the current price for the maxed out 12/256 version, it makes a lot of sense that you go for this."
143,I bought this phone only for snapdragon 855 processor and all new 90hz display. I am satisfied with the display and the performance it provides. I don't use camera of any phone so my review will not tell about camera. But as I've seen with this phone camera quality is little bit average I'll say. This phone have some serious issues about the weight balance and absence of 3.5mm jack (adapter is not available also inbox ofcourse they want customers to spend valuable money on there brand). And non availability of 3.5mm adapter on official site is also a problem. Stereo speakers are also soo average.
144,"Amazing performance. Gamers are gonna love this phone. I can't believe how incredibly fast the fingerprint scanner is.When it comes to camera, no words can explain its potential. With the right knowledge of photography you can capture amazing shots. In the pro mode it provides great features where you can control the shutter speed, iso, manual focus. You can check it out in YouTube.Coming to the display its very smooth. You can only feel the difference when you have been using your phone for a couple of days and then try to use your old phone.Battery life is good. But not that great. The 90hz drains a lot of battery.Theres tons of other things that make this phone great. Or else why do you think I would be typing such a long review.So guys, if you have around 50k budget, trust me, this is the one."
145,Seriously i bought this phone because i thought one plus is a true premium phone and one plus 7 pro would be a new flagship killer. Its been 2 weeks i have been this phone and started having problem with this.After the os update which one plus suggested 2 days back i have started having problems with this phone.During voice call other person voice is not clear always.Screen started hanging and many such small problems.Being such a premium smart phone manufacturer company i did not expect this issues from one plus.They always talk about the specifications and features but not about efficiency and reliability.Why such issues after every update.And i can not even see any difference after os update and update affected my phone's primary features.
146,"1. ScreenOMG. Use this Hulk once and you see all the other devices as tiny toddlers. Screen is the next Generation feature and it's absolute delight to watch youtube on this.2. Oxygen OSConfigurable. Sleek. Ease of use. It's addictive3. Top notch configWeather it's 12 GB RAM, 256 GB ROM or 30 htz Warm charging. It's top notch industry leading configuration. What more you will ask for?No wireless charging. No IP certification. Not required and no body cares.OnePlus becomes a market leader with this dream phone."

148,"This is beautiful gem. I ordered it even after knowing of all the issues people are facing on it, I was little afraid but thank God I am not facing any such issues, no ghost touch, no battery drain etc. Camera might not be good for people who regularly use high end devices, but it's not bad. The overall experience is just amazing be it sound from speakers, the beautiful display and the smoothness of OS' transition animations, and ofcourse the new haptic feedback motor is amazing, it makes the overall experience even better. If you have money to spend, don't hesitate and go for it."
149,Works like charm..... #oneplus Never makes their customer down...... But shows lill bit of sadism in releasing colours.... Overall im very satisfied wid CAMERA:- not soo wide angled but its great nd no additional things added jst like oneplus 6 nd 6 and front popup camera works fine and crystal clear images can be takenBATTERY:-works great whole day and heres a tip use fhd+ and 60hz refresh rate for better battery backup when u needy.....PERFORMANCE:- ONEPLUS never settles as it says..... Even i use 6gb ram not even small lag detectedStereo speakers and dolby atmos... Even there is no overhead speakers they managed well to cover it... Wat ever its a small defect but it works wellOverall it's great product from oneplus and  #NEVERSETTLE
150,"Great device you can buy on this OnePlus 6th anniversary sale at Amazon...(I bought it at 41,000 Rs 8gb+256 gb version with grey color) .After Android 10 update this device become super cool in every aspect ( with little bit tweaks and tricks).Pros : -1. Great display with dolby atmos sound support2. Fast charging feature 0-100% charge is done within an hour3. Fast fingerprint scanner4. UFS 3.0 support is great.5. Smooth gaming Experience6. Face unlock with pop up camera is COOLüòéCons : -After using Samsung device with oneui I feel Samsung is better in lots of factors, but this device is great if you considered its price.After buying this device Im very happy with this device. Great work done here specially in OnePlus 7 pro device from OnePlus Team ... I'm not lying but this is what I am imagine after I saw OnePlus 6 model coz this device makes great leap in every aspect from its predecessor models and fullfilled my 80 % of wishlist related smartphone.Thank You OnePlus and Thank You Amazon for making this happen!!! üòçüòçüòçüôè"
151,It's a beast.Exceeding all your expectations.Worth every penny.Jus hooe you may secure the phone.There's a pre installed screen guard tepered glass.Such a goot battery backup with the best charging speed.I recoreded on my watvh it have 38 mins for full charge frome 20%Camera is just worth it better than googlepixel just a bit down in protrait.Only drawback is you don't get earphones. Which OnePlus should have given in this pricerange.Hiving 5 stars on the basis of using ohone for 3 days.Worth it.
152,"Worst camera quality...... I thought I m getting the best phone but it's the worst one.... Plz do go for this mobile. With the amount of hype they made in media it's just a wastage of money. This is not a trusted brand to go for. Even I don't like to one star rest of the phone in the market will give the best phone with lots of features like vivo, oppo or Samsung. I raised a compliant with the tech team and will take it media for cheating us. I suggest all who are having the same problem take this to media in all forum, so that this company oneplus will understand and will do the needful. If not we have lots of ways to make them understand and return our money."
153,I've been an iPhone user for more than a decade and this is my secondary phone. I'm writing this review after having used the One plus 7 pro for over 2 months. This is possibly the best overall phone available in the market if the price is taken into consideration.Pro:Good camera for recreational use. (Not for photography enthusiasts).One of the best refresh rates. Makes the entire experience of using the phone seamless.The screen quality is amazing.The phone feels well built and almost premium quality.No NOTCHThe OS is one of the best I've used. Closer to the original android.Curved screen and 90 GHz refresh rate make it the best phone around for video viewing.Unbelievably Fast ChargingCons:The camera is not at the level of other flagships. It tends to correct photographs too much. If you're looking to click accurate pictures its not the best one out there.The phone is quite heavy.
154,1.) CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD BUT VIDEO RECORDING CONTINUES NOT WORKING PROPERLY WITHIN 25 SECOND RECORDING ONLY.2.) MOVIE SEE IN MOBILE NOT PROPERLY BECAUSE MOBILE SCREEN AGAIN AND AGAIN SMALL SCREEN DIVERT.3.) MOBILE TOUCH WORKING MISSING.4.) YOUTUBE SHOW WIRELESS HEADPHONE AND 2 EXTRA COVER WITH PHONE BUT NOT RECEIVED WITHTHIS PHONE.
155,"I had purchased one Plus 7 pro 8 GB Almond color from Amazon based on a friend's suggestion but totally regret the purchase. I'm a new user for One Plus & previously owned Apple, Vivo,Letv, Coolpad, Samsung, Honor, Motorola,Xolo,etc.,never experienced such an awkward performance in those mobile's. Spending half a Lakh Indian rupees on this mobile the File manager videos file's takes time to load in order to open the same, While on call second call gets answered automatically, Both front & Back camera clarity are not up to the mark & there are lots of other issues while using the mobile I'm not at all happy using this device & feel like exploited for buying a premium range mobile with a basic mobile's performance. Need a solution for the same at the earliest."
156,"This is my first phone in the premium category and I'm glad I went ahead with investing those extra 20000 rupees for a phone. 12 GB of RAM will look after every thing that you can ever ask of a phone. I had no idea of what difference a screen of 90Hz refresh rate or 60Hz meant. But after using this phone and having seen my friend's 6T I can say that a 90 Hz screen is so buttery smooth that it spoils you. Fingerprint scanner has gotten better with every touch. Battery performance isn't too great but it does charge lighting quick. The curved screen and the Fluid Amoled Display just packs that final punch.It's not always we think of going for a 50k+ phone and if you're thinking of upgrading your phone and have the budget, go for OP7Pro without any apprehensions.Edit: I'm no pro photograper but the camera seems to be better with additional features after the Android 10 update."
157,"Good phone. - Review after usage for a week.Best Full screen display i have used till now. Soo smooth(90hz refresh rate is a killer one).Camera is pretty good than the other mid-range phones (15 to 25k).Battery performance is nice. got full day(morning 9am to night 11pm) battery with single charge. (Since it is a new phone im spending more time with it, still battery is preforming nicely. im getting up to 7 hrs for screen usage time, with regular usage of whatsapp, instagram, facebook, insthorts, camera, photos, google news, Pubg(2 rounds), youtube (up to 30 mins), phones call of upto 20 mins) - Refresh rate - 90hz."
158,"I always have avoided oneplus so far just because how they call themselves flagship killer but yet miss on so many items, but with pro version oneplus has upped the game this year giving a tough competition to all the other flagships put there.Pros at a glance1. Worlds first phone with UFS 3.0, the phone is stupendously fast.2. QHD Screen with 90hz refresh rate, a very first on oneplus device. Once you get used to 90hz display all the other phones will be a joke in terms of scrolling performance.3. Great camera. Camera is great , though not to the level of many other flagships its great and there will gcam mods which will improve the quality.4. Stereo Speakers, again a very first on oneplus device, excellent quality.5. SD855 onboard.6. Warp Charge at 30W is sufficient enough to compensate the battery performance with 90hz displayCons at a glance1. No headphone jack.2. No type C to 3.5mm cable atleast.3. The phone is heavy.4. No OTG adapter."
159,"One of the best screen I've seen on a phone. Camera is brilliant, even in low light. Was skeptical initially due to some bad reviews, but contrary to those I don't see any issues so far. Been using for four days and tested out most of the features and loved almost everything about the phone, except for the weight. Battery life with 60Hz at this resolution is quite remarkable. 90Hz pushed through a day, but on 60Hz it's a breeze for day and half. I did notice few software glitches after the latest update while sharing cam clicked images via WhatsApp, but was fixed after a reboot. So no complaints there as well. Overall, find it worth for the money paid."
160,I was littlebit sceptical after reading some genera and negative reviews about it on the amazon as well as on YouTube...but after i used for 2 days ...i am loving it... camera has gone better after latest update ...and.....and this thing is pure Butter. Go for it....Best in its  class....not regretting a penny in 49k i spent....no issues yet
161,"I would like to say that this is not an 'out of world' product as you see in most of the reviews. The one and most amazing aspect I like about this product is its display for which I would give 4.5/5 compared to iPhone XS Max display which would be 4/5 according to my experience.  In performance factor also I would say that this will be the fastest phone I have ever used. Apart from these 2, this phone is just like any other Android phone in this price range or slightly above. The camera is just an average component and cannot be called as a flagship feature here (except night shots are pretty amazing though). The size is also quite huge that its difficult to operate it with just one hand. Charging is pretty decent and would take around .1 - 1.15 hours from 0-100. Battery back is the same as that of one plus 6t which will last for a day with a full charge and medium usage. Overall I would say this is an okayish product but not an amazing product from the future."
162,"Rubbish item!!!!! No data security . Phone gets unlocked by anyone , only thing u will have to do is just don't let the secondary camera pop up (by applying finger pressure over camera)after u press power button for 3-5 seconds. See and enjoy the magic!!!!!!"
163,"This was a great deal offered by Amazon. The phone quality is top notch. 90hz screen refresh rate gives a buttery smooth experience while using the apps which support it. In-display fingerprint reader is relatively fast and accurate. Haptics is improved and precise but not as good as iPhone which is a lot more expensive.Battery life is not awesome but decent as it drains out faster when the phone is used heavily while playing games. Although the warp charging does really help out here. The phone charges upto 50% in under 20 mins. This 50% lasts quite a while when used judiciously.Camera quality is decent again. Photos come out crystal clear and sharp in good lighting. Night photos are not very clear and have a lot of grain. Inbuilt night mode provides a brighter image but still there's grain visible in the photos. Selfie camera is also good. There is the motor noise when the selfie camera pops up and down. I dont recommend using the pop up camera for unlocking the phone.Considering the price, I would recommend this phone to anyone with this budget. This is 2019's best phone afterall."
164,"Starting with the camera quality, the phone takes gorgeous pictures. Within three weeks, OnePlus has send more than three updates centered on the camera and it gets better and better. Photos are sharp, colors a bit vibrant but I love it, video quality is better than any phone. Portraits are somewhat average, but that is true for any smartphone. Selfies too are of very good quality, and support nightscape.In very low light (almost pitch black with a few lights in the distance) the phone performed better than my expectations but I rarely use it for such situations. In normal low light (clubs, dimly lit rooms) it performs very well. I have attached a lot of camera samples. The best part about the OnePlus 7 Pro is the sharp quad HD display and with the 90Hz display, you can't stop just scrolling through your phone because it's so smooth and addictive. Everything from 4k videos to just the wallpapers look mesmerizing on this phone. The chin of the phone is also almost non existent, like the iPhone X.The fingerprint reader is very fast but takes more than one try with wet hands.The battery lasted much longer than the reviews said, easily finishing one day (and more than one with moderate usage and the battery saver turned on).The performance is just mind-numbingly fast. I realised its importance while opening PayTm which would always open slowly on my previous phone. No lag whatsoever.OxygenOS is a big reason to consider this phone because it is much better than the OneUI or Oppo/Vivo's wierd UIs.The only complaint I have is that OnePlus did not include a headphone jack converter in the box and the official converter on their website is out of stock. I tried a few cheap converters but sound quality was very bad. This is a trick for me to buy their new Bluetooth earphones WHICH I WILL NOT.Anyway the speaker quality is very very rich and good with Dolby Atmos so I can manage till I buy a pair of other Bluetooth earphones."
165,"This phone is awesome, but I can't really use my headphones right now because I didn't get a 3.5mm to USB Type C cable. I tried buying it on the OnePlus official website but it is out of stock.The 90Hz refresh rate and everything else about this phone is fantastic.I bought the 12GB variant and I guess it is completely worth, since it gives a tough competition to premium flagships of Samsung and Apple.I play a lot of video games and I find this phone perfect for a person like me.While playing heavy-duty games like PUBG or Fortnite, the battery drains a bit fast but you can charge it from 0-100 in an hour.The screen is really huge, and because of its features I guess the phone weighs a bit more than other phones do.I would definitely recommend buying this phone to my friends or colleagues."
166,The phone is absolutely FANTASTIC! Works like a charm. The best thing is the display! Nothing comes close to this!A few cons I noticed are:1. The phone is kinda long from the usual ones.2. It's heavy (especially since I jumped from Oneplus 3 - 150g to oneplus 7 pro - 200g)4. The case that comes with this is slippery so better to buy a new one. I'm looking for one now too.5. The battery seems to go down a little faster to my liking with the 90Hz on. I haven't tried 60Hz yet thanks to the WARP charger.
167,"I read more reviews on this phone and saw many videos of reviews and tech experts many of them say that it's the best phone in Android. As they mentioned seriously it's the really the best phone. Best features. I took 8gb ram 7 pro.1. Display, 2. Touch, 3. Camera, 4. Speed, 5. Design, 6. Battery life, 7. Fast charge.Drawbacks1. No headset jack.2. Portrait mode is only for limited distance.3. Memory card slot.As it is the premium phone and paying 53k we expect basic things like headset jack or the headset. But didn't even give the music jack connector.All the premium phones have wireless features but we miss in this phone. Hope it comes in next version."
168,Just one word . Amazing.  The speed is terrific and the response from the insane machine is mind boggling . It switches from tab to tab like lightning . Front camera is a pop but have no fear.  It's well designed and has fall prevention sensor . Phone doesn't have headphones slot and hence need to use wireless . Sound and video clarity is beautiful . I would suggest this phone to people like me who still believes in Android and for the love of Goodies it offers .
169,"I am very happy with the product. But what's the meaning of phone without headphone jack or connector. If we are buying the phone of 50000, the company cant even provide us the connector for earphone? I would suggest not to go for this phone until and unless they have a solution for this. Before buying this phone just think why didn't they provide Type C earphone or connector. If we are spending more than 30K on any phone. We expect all accessories for the same."
170,"I am writing this review after using two months , and using means playing pubg , listening music, 52 apps running in background i.e heavy usage of 8GB RAM. and I would say Phone is awesome with good battery life and i won't feel bored while using 90Hz refresh  rate with a crisp 1,440-pixel resolution.By refreshing 90 frames a second, things like scrolling through web pages and apps feels really fluid.So, here are my perspective :Advantages :1. Photos are clear, bright and vibrant and I'm impressed with the camera's HDR rendering.2.Buttery smooth and notchless 90Hz display.3.thanks to Oneplus for giving Wrap charger which charges the phone Superfast 55 mins.4.Talking of durability, there is Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back, but please have a screen protector .5.There is no heating issue while playing games or charging the battery.6.Over all Build Quality is premium , but slight slippery while holding it .7. AMOLED display which is very the best at this price range .Disadvantages:1.Questionable pop-up camera durability, mechanics is good but i really don't know what will happen while keeping in pocket or while taking pics outside.2.there are Dolby powered stereo speakers that output rich audio but no head phone Jack which means either u need to buy blue tooth headphone or a usb type c connector to headphone which is easily available in amazon (but can buy in cheap rate @ 59 outside ).3. Phone is Big and Bulky (which is manageable as it's a metal body).4.No water resistance rating ad wireless charging, which according to me is not required as it gives u an Additional Warranty of One year without extra charging  . No Mobile Company provides us 2 year of warranty .Hope this will be helpful , I would suggest just go for it who are the heavy user and don't want to purchase phone every year or who got annoyed of unusual notification from OS or pre-installed apps as It's a Nearly stock Android ."
171,"I received a new OnePlus 7 Pro just yesterday, and when I tried to add both my sim cards in it, I found out the second sim slot was too small to add even a nano SIM card.After spending a day going from one shop to another to have my sim cut and everyone saying it was too small already, I found someone with the same phone, and they opened their sim card tray and said mine was defective.What kind of pathetic service is this?!This has not only made me not want to shop for anything on Amazon, but also has made me hate the brand OnePlus.OnePlus's call centers are also not customer friendly.I recommend people not to buy this or any OnePlus device, because in such a situation you'll eaither be phoneless (during the period Amazon replaces it) or you'll have wasted such a huge amount on a defective phone, with no help from OnePlus."
172,"Ordered the phone on 16th.In love with the phone!THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SPEEDY DELIVERY. GOT IT DELIVERED AT 6:30 AM NEXT DAY!!!Yes it is little bulky and huge but i dont think any phone having more than 6 inch screen can be used by single hand.I have comparitively large hands and still 5.5 inch screen handling was difficult.Charging and phone Speed is Blazing fast. And display is beautiful and buttery smooth. Dont think any phone has this smooth touch!It lived to all my expectations and was worth the wait.My friend used my phone for a while and bought one for himself too!Highly recommend the phone to people looking for flagship phone.Remember, it is flagship phone with amazing hardware and features and hence the price. :-)"
173,Oneplus has really gone and done it this time around. So here's the review - Display - 10/10 (This is by far the best display in the market. Take my word for it  no youtube videos can show you the smoothness  that its 90hz display provides and is also a HDR 10+ display) Design - 9/10 ( The edges weren't really required but the still look really good) Battery - 7/10 ( the 90 hz display sucks alot of juice) Gaming - 10/10 ( by far the smoothest gaming experience i have had on a mobile device. I also own an iphone X and its even smoother than the X in gaming)All in all my only problem was the lack of a headphone jack and rest i am really satisfied with the purchase.
174,"S10(+) vs OP7Pro.. I chose this since it's superior in the OS, Warp charge, SD855 gaming and few more. It also matches up with its OLED display to the major flagships out there. Battery life looks good on my device atleast, Charges blazing fast. UI with this display is buttery smooth. These pop up cameras are fun and sturdy. Fingerprint reader feels faster over the OP6t. Camera quality is not up to the DXO mark, but would be improved by software updates which are seamless on 1+ devices"
175,"Loved it. But it has its own pros n cons. Best screen ever, with Dolby stereo speaker really awesome performance while playing games like pub g and call of duty. I have been using since two weeks now never felt a lag. But price is too high. It doesn't have notification light, no 3.5mm headphone jack,  battery drains fast. but it last for 1day. And having a warp charger it cahrge the device very fast."
176,"Two days as of now, simply best resolution yiu can get, will get a feeling of using 2phones, damn similar to s9plus edge.Well done ome plus. Camera has been improved , and yeass Nebula blue is the sexiest and the most unique color u will see.Feature wise, as they have mentioned its completly worthy.Just a upsetting about the potrait rear camera, hope they solve in update."
177,"The first time i bought OP7pro. I was shipped with a defective unit. The screen had burn in issues. I just don't get it. If i am the first owner of the phone, how can it have screen burn in. It is something, that develops gradually on prolonged use. Maybe they are selling refurbished ones in offers. I filed for a replacement. And its working great.The phone is great in all aspects. Just the battery time is a bit less. My unit also registers false touches while charging.The design is fabulous and fragile. ‚úåÔ∏èUpdate-Initially I gave it a 5star rating, then reduced one for the 3.5mm jack and battery."
178,"It is one hell of a beast.. and icing on the cake.. it's got 12Gigs of Ram..!! Great Camera.. gets better with every update.. Gaming is next level.. Pubg, COD, Asphalt you name it.. plays crazy with zero lag and Hdr.. Battery 7-8 hours on heavy usage.. but, that doesn't matter when I can warp charge it to 75%  in 30 mins..!! Hence 5 stars.Oxygen Os.. refined and customised for daily use..Display is a whole different story.. beautiful Amoled display.. for movies or Netflix.. no drop in framerate whatsoever.. It's a beauty..!!If planning to get it just go for it..!! Highly recommend it !!"
179,"Finger print reader is buttery smooth , camara quality is good but not excellent needs some more improvement. 1and half days of battery life. It depends on how you use the phone. If gaming is your priority it is smooth and fast but battery won't last long. Warp charger is fast . While charging phone heats up and automatically cools down at a percentage. By keeping in 90 Hz and resolution to auto switch it saves battery.The main flaw is no 3.5 mm jack, no type c to 3.5mm adaptor provided in the package .  Tempered glass not available for the phone in their website too.( If they are releasing a phone they should have accessories too but in OnePlus all accessories are out of stock). Price of the product is high. If they are pricing high they should have provided the adaptor for 3.5 mm jack , tempered glass and headsets in the package ."
180,"used for a weekPros :1) specs2) speed3) displayCons :1) display is too long , a feature like ""bring the display down while double tapping home button"" is needed2) volume up and down is sturdy and slow , i have to install a android app for controlling volume now3) no headphone jack, no HEADPHONE CONNECTOR also (i have to buy new one)4) phone lags on usage while warp charging.5) fingerprint reader works great for my right thumb , but for other fingers i have to try 3 times"
181,Phone became dead on the 11th day after purchase. Amazon has asked me to contact manufacturer. Let's see how things work out.
182,"Amazing phone. It was difficult for me even to think of shifting from Samsung. But since Samsung gave me a terrible phone through S9, decided to try one plus 7 pro.Superb performance.Gives me 24 hours battery. I do not play games on phone. But have a lot of calls. 200 plus everyday and many on Bluetooth. Even then by end of day 20 pc charge is left. The charger is very fast.Camera- superb. See the images. Some people said night photos are not good. See the quality of night pic I took.A bit heavy. But that's ok.Overall very happy"
183,It's worth the price. Yeah camera performance should be improved. Battery life for 90 Hertz refresh rate is not bad. Fingerprint sensor is faster than 6T.What I observed from people rating is they are disappointed because OnePlus didn't include type-c to 3.5mm cable and earphones because of high price.I think because of customers disappointment rating going down. OnePlus should think on it and should get back customers satisfaction.Overall phone performance will never disappoint you. Should include basic accessories to satisfy the customers.
184,"'One plus 7 pro fast, smooth and effortlessly powerful' as mentioned, or did the phone failed to live the hype. I am among those first mortals who got a chance to laid hands on this beautiful peice of technology and below are my findings after a week of use.Pros:1: Display- One of the bet that really paid off is the new edge to edge display in this phone, no bezels, no notch on the screen mean more screen to body ratio which looks quite stunning. However I am not facinated about the full screen display, I mean, yeah it's great but you can find this kinda tech in many sub premium phones available out there. The big surprise this time is the bump in resolution, the phone now sports a  6.67 Inch, 2K+ resolution OLED Display which was long needed since screen to body ratio has increased reasonably since One plus 3t and given the price tag. Another +ve side is fluid AMOLED with 90hz refresh rate, it's not cosmetic and I can say that because I am using a oneplus 3t along side this phone and I can easily see the difference in the screen response in 7pro, the animations are silky smooth, fast and flawless. Also another unique trait is this screen has got side edge display as like Samsung's edge series. All in all the display ticks all the boxes, no questions.2- Memory and storage: I am using a 12 GB ram n 256 GB rom version, given the amount of ram multitasking glitches are the things of past. I tested it's performance by parallely running nfs, pubg, asphalt nitro, clash of clans without any hiccups where as 3t faces some issues, thus heavy performance apps can run smoothly as the phone can take that all easily. Also 256 GB storage is enough to store images, vedios and files etc, given that we are living in cloud era.3 Speed: Speed has always been a trump card for oneplus  phones, and it's the imperative reason of it's existence. Even my 2 years old oneplus 3t never showed any noticeable lagg and 7 pro is no exception. Also this time the company has introduced liquid cooling to address over heating issues faced by early oneplus phones, however I still found some heating issue while playing multiple performance games but in normal day to day use it's just ok. This beast takes all performance load with ease, so stay relaxed this phone won't let you down.Cons:1: Camera: There is marginal improvement in the camera department from 6t but I didn't found anything much as mentioned in ads, I compared the shots with my friend's shots takes by s10+ and the later one stands out in terms of quality and wide view angle. S10+ camera on paper is low on megapixels but does better justice than one plus. Night pics are a slight better I can say, else Samsung's done a good job here.2 - Pop up front camera: This point may not appease to all the readers but I am not a fan of machanized camera. Even oneplus suggest not to use face unlock much. There is also another clever peice of tech here by oneplus, if accidentally the phone drops out of your grip while the the front camera is still out, the phone will automatically detect the fall by using the inbuilt gyroscope and immediately pops the camera inside even before the phone touches the ground. However given all these corks and screwes, I still doubt the front camera may show signs of break downs in the long run.3- Missing headphone jack- While there are few people complaining about missing headphone jack, I personally don't feel it's a loss as I rarely use wired earphones and also I noticed most of my friends too use Bluetooth earphones. Wired earphones are the things of the past, get yourself a pair of good Bluetooth earphones and bingo! u won't miss the jack anymore.4- Finger print scanner- Strangely the inscreen finger print scanner some time fail to recognize if you fingers are slightly moist due to sweat.Summary- Bit pricey when compared to the recently launched oneplus 7, but in terms of features and looks it's leagues ahead not just from it's own siblings but with most of the competitions as well."
185,#Stunned #Awesome# Super thrilledApril 2014.. The One plus silently entered the market and making a small ripples ..No one ever expected that it sweeps as Tsunami. I still remember the day when I bought the One Plus One. Happily showing to people about the greatest product . Sadly at that time no one aware about the phone but now we all know who is the real beastSlowly and steadily the brand was reaching all over .The word ‚ÄúThe Flagship Killer‚Äù literally killing the people all over. No one ever expected that it will capture the market just like that.From One plus we had more market players all were trying to reach the level of One Plus sadly the truth no one reached to it and still it holds the position.After One Plus one I was like missing the opportunity of moving to the next phone.. But my One Plus one was scoring so good so I didn‚Äôt feel for the next one..Time moves.. Used other products so called copycat of the Flag Ship Killer phones none were like my One Plus one. Something or other was missing.Now I don‚Äôt want to lose the opportunity so I banged on the first day and booked the ‚Äú The Real Flagship Killer‚Äù One Plus 7 Pro 8GB 256 storage.Now my Beast in Power on Mode and will Unleash soon‚Ä¶ Will come back soon with my next review of Pictures and Performance and all ..
186,"Today I received the parcel intact.The parcel contained only the phone and it's charger.There was no ear phone, operation manual,I find in a youtube regarding one plus 7 box containing earphone, operating manual,two type of mob.cover.(color choice).I would like to know the reason for the missing item.Please respond."
187,"Firstly, it's a review after 2 days of use. And what's not to like about this phone.If you're here then you already know the specs and I don't need to reiterate it. Its a beast, a killer phone.Things you'll love:1. Best camera performance.2. Amazing display (90 hz refresh rate and probably the brightest screen in the market)3. Super fast speed.4. Stereo speakers.5. Warp charge is amazingly fast (0 to 100% in 1 hr)6. An AnTuTu score of 367202. Beating 93% of all other phones out there.7. Price (at this price range you can't find a premium phone like this one)Things you'll miss:1. 3.5mm jack2. Battery performance (max 6 hr screen on time) but with the warp charge battery never bothers me.That's it.You will love every bit of it."
188,"My 3rd OnePlus and had a bit of additional hope from this model. Though not completely disappointed below are few observations after using this phone for few days.1. Too heavy for a phone compared with the other similar or near similar models.2. For some reason I don't see the battery is a winner.3. I do not play games. But apps like Amazon, Flipkart and few others have few seconds lag while opening it. So not sure if it is my phone or all have this issue.4. Camera is OK compared to other similar models available5. Instances of heating while browsing for a bit long. Clueless why5. Wrap charger and Dash Charger. Don't see any major difference. May be some technically, but as an user I personally don't see any huge difference.Finally the best thing happened is with mobile signal. It has improved a lot and I am happy that as a phone 7pro is doing a great job."
189,"Awesome product. Bought it despite of all criticism. Happy with my decision. When you are a tough competitor than people starts hating you, that's common. Display and performance are the benchmarks. Camera too is doing well with the latest updates, that's what i love most about the OnePlus, they listen to their community and keep you updated from all bugs. It's not light weight so if you are a skinny guy then forget about it or else go for it. Best phone under 50k. If you found it helpful then no need to smash the like button, you just go for this beast. Peace out"
190,"This is my first OnePlus DeviceAnd I can say this is the best phone I have ever used .The 90hz display is amazingI can guarantee once you started using the phone on 90hz you can't go back to lower refresh rate.. you will feel and can see the other phones lagging..Camera is not up to the mark but the latest update improve a lot .. and can be better in next updates..Battery life is good ... Not the best due to higher refresh rate and quad hd resolution.. but if you want good battery life you can do so by changing the screen resolution to full HD+ and the refresh rate to 60hz..The fingerprint is super fast..And the WARP Charge , this is amazing..The phone charges very quickly..Oxygen Os is awsm.. (best os ever)Weight - the phone is a lit bit heavy.. but if you use the case you wont feel it heavy.."
191,Fast and great phoneFast chargingOk camera better in gcam appBattery is not great in 90hz displayYou change to 60hz and battery saver it helpsAnd 90hz display is really great really smoothIt's offering a lot of value for the priceBecause the s10 iPhone are way more expensiveAsus Zenfone 6 and k20 pro all have regular diaplays that's why their cheapThis has a oled (very good )The os is really good better than stock AndroidLot of featuresIf you have the money go for it
192,Full 5 ‚ú≥Ô∏è.. also my 1st Oneplus...Touch sensibility 5/5Gaming 5/5Camera 4.5/5 (cartoon type pictures)Vibrator engine 5/5Screen ratio 5/5Battery backup 4/5 . (For 90hz refresh rate more power consumption)U have the bucks. Go for it.
193,"I ordered my OnePlus 7 Pro with lot of doubts in mind specially it not being water resistant and camera quality in previous versions.I highly recommend the OnePlus 7pro and writing this review so it might help others .Pro-1) Screen - Best Screen so far on any phone and with 90Hz refresh rate it is best mobile to play games with . I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.Cons :Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it's very slow but it does look good to flaunt.Weight : If you don't prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it's 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here. This time they really went Beyond Speed."
194,The battery back up on the so called 4000 mAh is only 7 hours. This 7 hours is with just 20 minutes screen usage.Raised a replacement request with Amazon. The technician who was supposed to visit on the scheduled day called up and mentioned that battery issue can come up because of apps and also the screen resolution. I have been using one plus 5t and it lasted 20-25 hours with the same usage and same applications. I had to put all my applications in optimise in the 7 pro to keep the battery last till evening. My friends using one plus 7 (not the pro) did not face any issue and their batteries lasted for over 20 hours.The worst part on Amazon's side is that the technician did not turn up and I got an email saying I was not reachable. When I contacted the technician he mentioned that he was busy with other customers and so he turned down my req. Now Amazon calls me back the next day from some unknown number and asks me for my details to place this technician request.Why playing cheap tactics to avoid replacement amazon by extending the dates ?
195,The phone is worth of money .I have seen on youtube they provide headphones and car dash charger with two extra cover.But i didn't get any of them totally disappointed with one plus team.If they are not giving such things then they should not show such things in their videos along with box .
196,Everything was great. This is my first OnePlus device and I really love it. Some people complaint some things in review section but if you want to get good quality product then ignore those negative reviews and go for it.
197,Product is awesome but delivery was delayed.the first thing you'll notice is that it is blazing fast. The camera pops up everytime for facial unlock which looks a little bothering somehow otherwise this phone is power packed. Battery life will go on for more than a day for me easily with daily chores on my phone as I am not a gamer.
198,"I have been using OP7 Pro for last 7 days and I found performance of the phone, camera, battery live up to OP expectations until 7th days.  I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won't start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don't want to."
199,"This is my personal review after 2 days of usage and one thing is for sure , that this is the BEST DISPLAY ever, just like said at the event ""FAST AND SMOOTH"". Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn't really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won't mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.One thing which I want to bring in notice is the ""NIGHTSCAPE"" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.Overall I will give it ""4 stars out of 5"". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. üññüññ"
200,Everything is perfect except for the fact that the shipped phone was having a scratch. Came to know when I removed the pre - applied screen guard to apply the new one. Pathetic.Amazon should definitely look into it. I need a replacement. This is absolutely absurd. We spend 50+ and get this shit.
201,Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. coming to product iam using 8GB version no words to say the speed is in controlled didn't get any lag it's very smooth.Screen OnePlus you nailed it 90hz awesome to use battery some are complain about SOC but iam getting 7hr 30 min roughly which is pretty best as my side.
202,Wonderful working experience..amazing Display quality.. unbelieve it..üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
203,Awesome mobile I'm writing this review after a week of using it... Phone was really cool n smooth no words can explain how good it is... Phone was fully loaded with advance features.. camera quality is too good no need to carry ur DSLR camera... Fingerprint is too good n too fast...Battery backup is great... Over all the build quality is awesome and phone looks stunning... Love u one+
204,Writing review after a weekPros :- Worth buying it.- Premium look and design- Lightweight and fast Oxygen OS- Display quality is awesome specially one can feel difference of 90Hz refresh rate vs 60Hz- Best experience for playing games and videos on QHD+ fluid AMOLED- Sound quality is best with Dolby Atmos- Battery life is really good. With full battery it works for more than a day with moderate use of phone with gaming & watching videos- Camera quality is not up to a mark compared to other flagship phones but better than its previous version 6TCons :- No 3.5 mm headphone jack- No IP rating for water resistance- Slightly bigger in size- Slightly heavy in weight- Ghost touch on cornors. Hope this would be resolved in upcoming software updates.
205,"Best Gaming Experience90 Hz Frame Rate implies smooth displayCrazy SpeedSuper Fast ChargingEven with High-end games like Asphalt 9, Battery does not drain fastDisplay is magnificentThe only limitation is some may find the size too big and screen too big,but for an average person like me, It is better than anything I ever imagined.Great Job One Plus."
206,"Genuine review, i have other flagship phones and for a moment i thought I'll try something new which was one plus 7pro, and i regret my decision since then. It is one of worst phone..they have priced at premium phone. But it's nowhere premium phone ..i feel it upgrade version of MI phones..not sure what this gimic is. Qhd 90hz refresh rate..all nonsense. Camera is biggest let down..with no waterproof certification and wireless charging..i regret i hav seen all this before..now i want get rid of this phone..i want to sell ..used only 1month..it's a cheap phone with highly priced."
207,First of all this phone is value for moneyThe camera quality is phenomenalExcept for the front camera performance in dark confition is very poorThe finger print scanner is not that accurateThe battery life is very goodBest battery in any smart phoneThe display is greatPotrait mode is avgNight scape mode is amazingBetter than s10 plus in all aspectsIf you are confused btwn note 10 pls and op7proGo for op7pro
208,"This phone is very much modified than previous models of OnePlus.Pros: Very fast finger-print sensor, awesome UI, Bigger than bigger display which is awesome!, 4K recording is nice.Cons: Camera quality issue, much weight, heating problem.But overall this phone is the best."
209,"Hi one plus /Amazon team,  the one plus seven I used has a glass internal hairline Mark and glass flows from inside on bottom left corner. It can lead to stress in glass and self breakage or blast. I have seen it today ...one day after return window is closed. Please allow to replace ..it is a manufacturing defect"
210,i face many problems and getting frustrated because of  many issue likealthough big ram but still it hangs . touch pad working automatically even after screen lock...the screen lock is not working and you can unlock with only one up swap...and automatically dailed numbers....
211,"I love the device..but it doesn't come with any accessory.. nothing at all..that was pretty disappointing cause, in other countries it came with a lot of accessory.. really interesting ones..why the different approach to us...the camera is just insane...the details it captures with night mode is also interesting...finger print reader is insanely fast..camera quality is at par with all similar devices of other brands...I bought it for the camera and it delivers"

I have tested it a lot by dropping the phone.Cons -Price is too high for sure.Full glass back that can shatter easily with 2-3 drops .No 3.5 mm jack . Type C convertor is inconvenient to use.Case provided is of so average quality"
213,Am requesting for mobile lovers who need something new in mobile please leave this don't buy one plus. If u buy you will suffer like me promise. No options in this mobile . In this generation even 10000 mobile also giving lots of special settings in mobile but one plus fails . And I get very bad experience with full screen display also how silly thing this was . Who given this one plus as a flag ship shameless.
214,"I would like to thanks One plus for launching this amazing mobile..camera is awesome , beyond expectation.. especially the night mode.. battery back is good..touch screen is like butter...overall I will suggest this is best smart phone I have ever seen around me..I am sharing this after using around 15 days..."
215,Dislay-Great 90hz QHD+ AMOLED display5/5Camera- It is good but struggles in tricky situation especially in low light but still its 4/5 on camera department.UI - 1000000/5Sound- Loud and clear but bass is little off 4.5/5Battery- It hogs a lot of battery. You need to carry that WARP Charger around if you want to last a day if you watch a lot of YouTube/Netflix or play games. Otherwise for a typical user it would last a day 3/5.Charging Speed - 10/5

217,"3 things :-1 Camera - Camera is like 15000 phone Ka Ho, Camera is not What i expected after spending so much..2 - Fingerprint - Sometime it irritates!!  im like Bhai Bhool Gya kya mujhe..3 - Not Feature rich like Samsung s10plusNow If you like Speed then Go for it, But Camera is where 1+ has to do Something & i m shocked that this phone doesn't have 960fps slowmo!!!  Thats why im saying 30000 is okay for this phone.. & Guys It is Heavy Brick so be prepared.. Charging is Really fast, Screen is Awesome, 855 Dragon is Does the job.. But still i wont suggest this phone unless u get it below 30000..Thank you"
218,"I got my first OnePlus 7 pro after a week it's launched but the Pop up camera not working properly... so I requested Amazon and theyvsent someone for inspection. After that when this defect is confirmed, I got my mobile on 2 nd day.. Thanks Amazon for responding so fast.After one successful replacement I finally got my phone. One plus 7 pro is one of it's kind. No comparison..... Video quality and stability mind blowing.... Camera quality decent... Touchscreen works like charm.... U will understand after using it.... Screen - OMG! really appreciate this approach.After having blazing fast processor and amazing fluid amoled screen i am pretty impressed that it stays long enogh ... Almost 18 to 20 hours... I playbpubg, watching videos on YouTube and Amazon prime.... Though its give very decent battery life....After 1 month of full usage I can say proudly that I am satisfied with this product. A bit disappointed on OnePlus for not adding the type C to 3.5 mm jack. But overall its a mobile worth of 50k...."
219,"One plus is nothing more than a social media hype, the phone are generally coming with minor defects. I first ordered this and fingerprint reader came with defect after which I followed with amazon badly but got poor response. The phone was replaced in close to 7 days of time, the second phone also came with defect and it is heating up even over 45 degree while in normal usage and now it is a pain. Moreover amazon have very bad support on this. Polishing used on phone is also bad, after 10 days of normal usage scatches have appeared on phone not on glass back but on metal side of phone."
220,"One major drawback is that you cannot make folders inside the apps screen. Whats the point in spending 60k when you cannot even organise your work. Everytime you go to apps screen , just try finding the app you are looking for. Also amazon just replaces and doesnt allows us to return the phone. Never buy in my recommendation.......go for samsung note 10 instead......"
221,Have never used an Android phone before with this much speed.A bit of device getting heated while charging otherwise all device and features is good.And what a screen this has. üòä
222,It is very good product. But only one negative point that the price of the phone is high and we don't get earphones also. I thought they would give a normal earphones. And it doesn't have earphone jack so it should provide some other thing so that we  can connect our normal earphones.battery drains very fast.the overcome this they have provided nice charger but it is of no use if we are out of the house we cannot charge it.
223,"Excellent phone. Delight to see & hold in your hands.OnePlus has done an excellent Job - they picked all new funtions , new technologies (pop-up camera, curved screen, QHD dispy, on-screen finger print, 90 hrz etc. ) & added to this phone. - Intelligent approach.Has an excellent screen, 90 hrz is exceptional experience ( now when I use my older phone, it looks like sluggish)Very responsive finger print. Good battery (for me at least), innovative gestures etc.Overall an excellent experience. Thanks"
224,"1-Bettery should b optimised but i m okay with the warp charge thats pretty fast2-Device is heavy in weight3-camera is the most important highlight in any device, its good but not like other flagships, it need an improvement via software update4-Speed is awesome5- Gaming experience is top class, its very smooth6- Display quality is awesome, vivid, colourful, sharp and very smooth7- From my opinion there should some more font styles like samsung8- Video experience is very crisp and clear9- Streo sounds are loud and clear with dolby support10- Oxygen OS is best in world, so many customizable options are available11- 3.5mm jack is missing, its very sad, so i have used new oneplus wireless bullet 2 and the experience was just never before12- IP rating is missing , its almost now flagship level pricing so oneplus should maintain this13- Fnatic mode is very helpful during game play15- Camera night mode is nice"
225,Great Delivery from Amazon. Got it delivered on 17th with morning delivery. Now let's talk about phone.Display is just one of the best. It's 90hz display makes the phone seem so smooth. It's just like a butter. Performance is always awesome in one plus and this takes one step forward with UFS 3.1. camera is a good improvement over 6T but still can't be compared with other flagship.I was little hesitant about pop up camera but oh boy it works awesome. It is a good implementation. Phone box doesn't include USB to 3.5m converter. Charging speed is awesome. Camera is good but requires some software optimization.
226,"What I like--Excellent performance, fast bootup and instant app loadup-Display is the one that impresses me the most with its 90hz refresh rate and curved glass-Build quality is great, slim design and glass back give the premium feel-OxygenOs is great, gives one of the best UI experience-Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos makes the sound crisp, clear and loud.-Has gaming mode which boosts up the performance while gaming-Camera is great, but needs improvement.-Charging is very fast and also doesn't refrain from using phone while charging-Lastly, on screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurateWhat I dislike/ poorly like--No headphone jack-Box hardly contains any accessories unlike other flagship phones; no type-c adapter, no complimentary headphones, no otg cable; only charger and sim ejector tool-Hybrid Sim slot-Photos clicked have heavy detail loss, when magnified the objects far away seems smudged, not expected in a flagship phone like this.-Face unlock is a bit slow due to popup mechanism-Battery drain is high when operating it at QHD+ resolution and 90hz display but can go for a day with moderate use.-Factory applied screen protector is of very low quality, doesn't even stick properly on the edges-Finally, price is bit high compared to other flagship phones with similar specification."
227,"If you want to buy a true flagship phone and don't care about brands, then buy it. Probably the best screen and performance in the market right now and an excellent camera. Battery is decent and warp charging is a thing of dreams.Pros -1. Best display ever.2. Best performance stats.3. Decent battery life. Fastest charging.4. Excellent camera. Pixel and Samsung does it better.5.excellent stereo speakers.5. Price is cheap.6. Stock android feel with some upgradesCons -1. Bulky and heavy.2. Not up certified. Some reviewers claim it to be splashproof though.3. No headphone jack and wireless charging."
228,"Ok first let me tell you something. All the negative reviews are before the OTA update. So if you are wondering whether to buy it or not, don't think again. This mobile is a beast.Pro'sTop class displayNo notchesVery Good battery. Getting 7.5 hrs SOT with 90hz+ QHDStereo Speakerssplash resistantOxygen OS (I am sure it will go till Android 12)Super fast indisplay Finger print scannerCon'sNo headphone jack. Not even converter provided. I thought there will be one.Pretty Okish Camera. Hoping for some good OTA updates.No LED notification lightFinally Camera to Api is enabled. So install Gcam and it will do wonders."
229,"The phone is very good. Two weeks of usage and there is no problems with my unit. Camera is good, not awesome neither aweful as some reviewers advertised. Battery life is good but not great, the best part is the display that can be termed awesome. Overall a good phone to have but there are other alternatives if you are willing to go.Features:1. Flagship processor and built2. Awesome Display3. Good Battery life4. Good Camera performance (didn't expect to be good because of some biased reviews)5. Nebula is the new favourite6. Oxygen Os"
230,One Plus 7 Pro is the  Best phone till date under one plus flagship.Well I think it has both Pro and Cons.I have listed them down as per my observation.Pro:1) Super Dispaly best in class and at this price.2) Battery backup is excellent.3) Camera is great please dont compare it with Samsung.Try the same in low light..4) Processor speed is superb with no heating issue .5)Quick charging and very fast clock speed.Cons:1) A bit heavy.2) No headphone jack.I had thought atleasy with this range of price they should provide us headphones and a Back cover.I think they have only reserved those things for Technical reviewers.If you see any technical review of the product they will get all accessories but a regular buyer won't.
231,An amazing phone with everything you need.It provides an ultimate user experience with 90hz display everything is so smooth never experienced lag yet.Fingerprint reader is fast but 1 in 10 times it might not recognize your fingerprint and that's okay one can settle with that.It is much better than the gaming phones out there with fnatic mode and the display it is just perfect.The camera was good with some minor issues when i received the phone but after the update the camera experience has been alot better.It provides me a screen on time of around 5-6 hours  which is quite good because i am a heavy user.*All in all this phone justifies it's pricing*
232,I bought a oneplus 7pro and i was happy but oneplus doesnt provide type c to 3.5 mm jack.. i have managed by not having audio jack in phone but why didnt u give the connector in the box content.. I was vry disappointed with oneplus... I have paid 49k for a phone and i didnt get a type c to 3.5 mm jack connector!! This is vry disappointing..
233,"Everything is great about the phone except for a few things.1. Due to curved edged screen, touching at undesired points becomes eminent, which leads to opening apps randomly which I don't want to.2. Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro gets stuck if the file size is beyond 2 MB, even with 8 MB RAM!3. Screen guard which comes with the phone by default, is of quite poor quality. Mine got worn and torn within first 3 weeks.But apart from the above, the phone's performance, battery, camera, sound, speed - everything is just great! Despite the minor flaws, I am loving this one!"
234,"If there's one thing that caught my eye when my colleague bought this phone is the display. It was a stunning 2k+ Quad HD display after all. It then lead me to look for video reviews from the youtube experts. It turns out, they did appreciate the display and phone. It's amongst the best displays on a phone in recent times and it's a Samsung panel.Pros of this phone:1. Ultra smooth beautiful quad hd screen with a 90 Hertz display. It is 6.67 inches in size including the curved edges. It's great for social media,videos which can render in 1440p if available and for reading too. It also does not have a notch and you pretty much love it.2. Battery life with a 4000 MAH battery is great when you consider that you use a 90 Hz refresh vivid qhd screen. Your could switch to 60 Hz but nah. :)3. Back cameras do a good job in capturing pics. An yet to really test them. The front 16 mp pop up camera works well. It's a good camera setup.4. It's got the SD 855 processor and it's butter smooth and fast.5. With the oxygen OS, it delivers near stock Android experience. It will very soon be upgraded to 10.6. Warp charging: it's got crazy fast charging compared to op6 which I have before this and 90% will get your through the day and more.7. The on screen finger print sensor is great to use.Cons:1. It's a heavy phone at 200 grams. You will take a week to get used to it since we all are so adaptive.2. It's got a curved display with curved edges. Accidental Ghost touches do occur from time to time. Also, your need to be careful. If you drop it face down, it will fall on the screen side given its weight and with the curved edges, there is a chance to break.3. With the launch of the OP7t, One plus has diluted the significance of this phone. We Indians are price conscious and the OP 7t costs 7k lower than each of the OP 7 pro models even after prices dropped on the 7 plus pro (OP 7 pro costs 4k lesser than when launched 6 months ago).Update: just found that there's a One Plus 7t Pro launching on October 10th 2019. With it, this will be definitely be the undisputed OP Flagship.4. For the price, no type C to 3.5 mm jack connector in the box, no type C ear phones, no wireless charge, no waterproof certification but you do get a case.Verdict:If you want the great screen, FHD+ 2K+ display, 90 Hz refresh and notch less design, go for the one plus pro. If you want most of what pro has, a balanced phone, some additional features and are ok with the 2k display and notch screen design, go for One plus 7t which is a super budget flagship killer too."
235,Very bad service of amazon there is no content service .There is a option to call but no one call me .Sepaker hv problem sometimes . Suddenly Stop working.Ppl Complan that thr is some eco or damage voice and n mic .Please help
236,"So I changed from iOS to Android ,previously used iPhone 8 what a great phone it was no complaints coming to one plus 7pro at first I was apprehensive about this phone whether to buy or not after thinking a lot finally bought this one , I don't use camera that much so issues there , finger print scanner has small issues but it's okay , coming to screen larity it is the best . Over all it's a good phone for one year use .. rest is best .."
237,I was skeptical on whether to buy it or not but ended up buying it. I was not expecting much but it surprised me because of it's blazing fast speed and excellent performance. I recommend you guys to buy it. You will not be disappointed
238,"Phone is simply Superb. Camera, screen, speed, quality and look and feel.Only area of improvement is battery. But yeah, with this performance you won't be disappointed with buying a power bank for this phone.And Warp charging is soooooper fast."
239,"Screen is great & treat to watch movies & videos. Don't really feel difference of 90hz. Software has glitches & apps crash sometimes. Bought fone after seeing camera ratings on Dox, but to my surprise the quality is very very average & portrait mode struggle a lot with image quality under good artificial lighting. Overall unimpressed with the fone after paying 50k. Hoping software updates will solve the issue. If want oneplus Suggest to buy cheaper 7t else of budget is good go for Samsung s10."
240,"Super display quality, great touch feel,best in camera phone, battery life is ok,rest super mobile overall .But theres only one big caution the discount which Amazon mentioned in terms of (no cost EMI discount) is totally rubbish the cost of mobile is 50999/- we have to pay to them if we choose 6months EMI option we have to pay 8499.93√ó6=50999.58.Then why mentioned no cost EMI discount and all  it shows the value of one plus 7pro is RS 48979.64 in order summary.who will give this discount of RS 2019,Which Amazon mentioned in order summary."
241,Oh my God awesome product!The screen is freaking smooth and nice build quality. Camera is better than any other one plus phones and even competes other cameras.Battery is bit on a rough side and is expected due to 90hz screen rate but it charges equally well and very fast.Loving it
242,What a phone. Totally worth every penny. The screen is the main attraction. The quality is out of this world just woowww.  The camera is good I won't say it's the best. But the smoothness is unreal the speed is unreal it's silly fast. And cherry on the cake is the wrap charger it charges your phone in no time. The look is classy and soft but still impactful.
243,"Been using this for 10 days.The display is excellent ( not as good as Samsung oleds but still a great display considering the 90hz and QHD panel.)Battery life is good enough for an average user, warp charging helps a lot when you're in a hurry.Camera is also good enough imo but it should improve via software updates ( you can still install the Google camera mod though).Performance is excellent on this one!! No lags or anything like.Keep in mind that this is a big and relatively heavy smartphone.Overall an excellent smartphone, but if camera is your HIGHEST priority, go for pixel 3a.I'm happy with my op7 pro."
244,"At start the handset crashed,showing android had stopped working. Then I contacted One plus care and the advised to either replace or do the hard reset. The hard reset worked and the phone is working perfectly.Performance,charging speed,camera,display everything is good. Sound clarity is also good. Overall a good flagship product. üòä"
245,1. Display and wrap charging is really awesome2. Battery life is good on 60Hz speed and okish on 90Hz3. Speed of  faceunlock is good and fingerprint reader is VVGood
246,"The product is simply awesome. One plus has surely  put a lot of work to make such elegent design and superfast device. The screen experience is just out of the world, its buttery smooth. Speed has always been the forte of One plus and Kudos to the team you wont even find one slightest of a glitch while using this device. Allso dont worry if you hate waiting for long hours to get your battery charged, the new 30W Warp charger does its job for you in no time. The camera quality is also decent and fulfills all your daily requirements. Overall the experience has been very good and trust me you wont be regretting your purchase, So if you are planning of buying one simply go for it."
247,"The display is just too good. I was unsure about the battery life because of mkbhd. But in my use I'm getting around 7 hours of SOT with 90hz and 2k resolution.Post camera update, the hdr issues have been almost solved.In my opinion the higher price is worth it, the other flagships at least in India are way too overpriced"
248,"*Fingerprint Reader : Very fast and excellent*Camera : Nightscape shines the brightest, overall camera quality has improved drastically with recent updates*Battery life : More than enough for a day of heavy to moderate usage*Os : Oxygen Os with Android 10 gives excellent user-friendly performance*Display : 90hz packed with QHD display gives amazing visual and ultra smooth touch experience**With MKBHD's ""Phone of the year Award"" Overall  performance of this phone is excellent and one should definitely go for it for complete user-friendly and buttery smooth experience **"
249,"Writing review after exact one month of usage.Pros:1. 90hz display: Full screen 90hz display will make you want to go back to your phone again and again. It's smooth, it's amazing in a layman's term. If you're a gamer, prefer watching movies on your phone you'll definitely love it.2. Camera: Camera quality is superb and I personally feel is at par with iPhone XI and outdoes iPhone in several conditions3. Battery: It offers a superb battery back-up lasting whole day without heavy usage. Even with the heavy usage the battery drain is quite slowCons: None so far.I know One Plus 8 is around the corner but if you're a fan of full screen display then One Plus 7 Pro is a go to phone, because speculations are rife that One Plus 8 will feature a punch hole display which I personally feel is a step back."
250,"Hi All,Here below i have put some point about the One Plus 7 Pro (8GB RAM +256 GB storage) after using about 20 Days. I hope this will be informative for you.Pros1) It looks very stylish and slightly curved display is added beauty of this mobile.2) Display/Screen is large and give ultimate movie/video Experience3) I did use the 1+ 6 earlier as well so comparison to that it's far better than if i compare the sound quality. it Gives 3D sound effects4) Vibration intensity is quite good5) Charging speed is good, But to get the 100% charge it takes long time6) Rear Camera is very good, But Video/Image stabilization is less than one plus 6, and slow motion video requires high lights, capturing motion object is not good. but wide image capturing and day light shots still will not disappoint you.7) Front camera here is pop up camera so according to me for the selfie you do not need to clean Everytime... so i like it personally8) Storage is enough to handle your data9) Data transfer rate via cable or Wireles is fast, But also produce heat10) Finger Print is OK, I will not say bad but its not lightening fast11) overall it's good product will not disappoint you when you will go for thisCons Hardware is strong but there are some software problem which i face i will mention here... its not a show stopper but One Plus need to look into this.1) If you remember one plus 6 that gives alphabet reflection  ""S"" on its glass panels and it was added style... but One plus 7 they didn't provided that kind of reflection.... i am not happy with that2) No accessories like earphones with the box3) I purchased type C bullets earphone from one plus but it is not smooth to insert and move out from type C port4) Pre applied screen protector there is bubble in curved corner.. So i think  it will not work for me for long time :(5) Now come to the software isssue- Screen Auto Brightness is not well tuned- Rotation sensors is not work well some time you need to slap the mobile to work the same :(- Rotation sensors not works for all mode of example if you are looking some file from the file manager  and you want to horizontal look into that so that will not work- Supposed you have opened the WhatsApp and suddenly call come then you will not able to who is calling and what number its you need to click on that-When call is active in SIM 1 you will not receive mesg on SIM 2 , I faced this issue many time i used to disconnect the call to get that message- When i put my mobile in pocket and when i move out from my pocket it says to many wrong or incorrect Finger attempt kind of message.. so I guess may be pocket sensors is not there or i have not enabled some settings on it- There are many other software issue i observed which i faced i dont want to make this post lengthy by this so moving next-Screen recoder should work in background, but here it gives dot symbol, So what if i want to record activity on my mobile in hidden way ? there is no option6) Cover is good fited but to charge the mobile you need to move out  the plastic cover from type C port but after using 20 days shape has changed of that and its not covering any more type C port, then why they haven't cut that piece which is almost unused. its very annoying to see that pieceNote : These above software issue points should not stop you to buy this product... These are minor problem that can be rectified by newer updateand i want to appriciate and wish good luck to One Plus and it's team for this product. Such a nice product."
251,Worth every buck.Finally one plus has involved and presented a better shaped handset.- Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.- Best in class camera.- Better battery life and charging
252,"Mobile is awesome, Its very handy, beautiful in hand, superb in speed and best camera used so far. If you look for some smart device in your hand, fastest speed and you like quality photography. Oneplus 7pro is the device."
253,The best phone ever...videos in YouTube wit 1080 so real it can go beyond that...camera amazing shots... about camera shots it has every single bit of clearity when u capture...just need to dig into the settings part...I'm in love love love love love with my one plus 7pro nebula colour..it's amazing... performance n everything lots to say...but this is the best ever phone for next future...catch me if u can settle hahaha...cos m settled already..
254,"1 star for Amazon not to phoneDon't buy on NO COST EMI else you will regret on your decision. I bought it on No cost now I am paying EMI og 9127‚Çπ per month with 800‚Çπ tax and gst.Overall I am playing 9927‚Çπ for 6 months that means I will pay them 59,562‚ÇπThat was a biggest nightmare in my life.Phone is awesome but price manipulation was also awesome"
255,"Not impressed at all with OnePlus 7 pro (12GB RAM) Other than night mode picture quality.Cons-- Phone heats up while playing the game and this not what I expected for a 12 GB RAM, RAM size is literally a waste of money.-- Phone is bulky fat and heavy does not fit in all kind of pant pockets.--  Battery life is worse than my previous OnePlus 5T I regret giving away my 5T for this.ProsNight mode picturesNotch less full-size display.My OnePlus 5T was a lot better than this I will not buy a OnePlus again better by a Samsung. or Huawei.  I believe this no much difference with OnePlus 7T either. I wanted to return it but the policy won't let me do that, not impressed Amazon, I regret not reading Amazon return policy before buying."
256,"The phone has disappointed me on various fronts. I have 8Gb and 256 Gb variants. Despite being the higher end of it's offering, it doesn't perform up to its standard. It hangs very often even while single-tasking. It's a shame on One Plus that even their camera doesn't respond while clicking the pictures. Their customer support is neither responsive not agile. They still are very parochial in their approach and it's better to go for some brand that listens to their customers."
257,I was using 1plus 3T from last 2.5 years and I was satisfied with it. I was happy that I am upgrading my phone with 1plus 7pro which I have heard about a lot but my expectations were shattered when I used its camera. The camera quality is very poor as compared to what has been shown in the launch event. I am very disappointed with it as my main purpose to buy this phone is because of its camera. It's battery life is also just OK as I have to charge it on frequently basis
258,"Best flagship available right now. Worth the money..Pros :Display, processor, speakers and battery life.Cons :Camera needs little improvement. Fingerprint reader lags sometimes. Still compromised with it's performance.Overall bang for the buck."
259,Fastest Android mobile in market..it has its own flaws however the positives covers them up..Pros:1. Design2. Screen and refresh rate3. Battery life4. Stereo speakers5. Oxygen OS6. PERFORMANCE7. CHARGINGCONS:1. Camera it's not bad at all but does not meet expectation.2. No 3.5 mm headphone jack or adapter3. Finger print reader works 9/10 times but with wet fringers you simply cannot login4. Pricing (should have been competitive)Overall it's a near flagship which ticks almost all the boxes but disappoints with the camera...Fastest Android with great display and special mention about 90hz screen... In my opinion this is a futuristic mobile ...
260,"Such an awesome device.Looks : 10/10Performance: 10/10Camera: 9/10UI: 11/10NO DOUBT, this model will create some records."
261,"Dream mobile,Got this by yesterday night.Solid build quality,display is butter smooth and cristal clear.Good üîãBest cameraFlagship specs with curved display under 50k.Practically best deal by comparing to competitors.#Blind purchase"
262,"Fingerprint is very fast and accurateCamera is not so good for 52k but it does its jobPhone its self very fast and smooth no lag at allThat's good battery backup...Charges completely in 76 minutes,"
263,"The screen size and viewing has just spoiled me.The bezeless screen with curved display is really to die for. I don't know if I can ever go back from this screen to any other device now.The processing speed is really really good.It doesn't slow down when it is dying in battery or if 4-5 apps are running in parallel. Processing is just flawless.When I was buying this phone, I was continuously told that camera is something u won't like. However, to my surprise till now the images taken are just amazing.Really love the portrait mode and wide angle feature on this. So amazing.Overall mobile feels really premium in your hands.Must recommended buy if this comes under your budget."
264,"Please see the attached video. This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus. Never gone buy any oneplus product again."
265,I bought it for my friendCamera AwesomePerformance MindblowingLook ShinyPrice Not ok with thatFingerprint Very responsiveBattery life upto 8hrsBest in class camera
266,One Plus 7 Pro has brilliant specifications. Camera zooms upto 10x. Took a photo of the moon not a single pixelation in image when zoomed at 100%.
267,"I have been using this phone for almost 7months now, I upgraded from Nexus 6P and this is my first oneplus phone.The screen is excellent and it is the biggest USP of this phone. It is a breeze to use this phone, UI is uncluttered and minimalist.However, the worst part of this phone is FINGERPRINT SCANNER which ruins the entire experience of using the phone. They snapped on a half baked technology called optical fingerprint scanner, more than 50% time it doesn't work. I tried multiple times deleting and enrolling again, it did not improve. It is not that it doesn't work but it is unpredictable when it won't work. Imagine you try to unlock the phone using finger and it doesn't work on repeated attempts and you have to finally enter the PIN to unlock the phone. Imagine having this repeat 15-20 times a day !! All this with a clean thumb, if you got wee bit of dust or dirt on your finger, just forget it !!. For example, after you open your car door and get in, I can guarantee that the phone unlock wont work, a little bit of dust on the door handle is enough to kill this. I am truly frustrated with this, my nexus 6P had physical scanner on the back and it never failed; instant unlock every single time, may be it didn't work once in a million attempts.To circumvent this problem, I can't use face unlock either! because this has got a pop up camera that needs to pop up do a face unlock, the phone throws a warning if you retract the pop up camera a few times. I originally intended to keep the phone for 3 years but now I am so frustrated that I am looking to move to a Samsung or something better."
268,"So been using it for a week and a half or so ,here's the layman review the kind I would've wanted to read here in the review sectionPro's-SCREEN- so good you'll find it hard to keep the phone away from you for even a little while .It's butter like crazy smooth.DISPLAY- be it qhd or fhd things are way above par a premium experience warm and subtle bright colors soothe your eyes enhanced by the resolution options offered by the phone . It's 'For your eyes only '.CHARGE- it's 'warping' fast I charge my phone at 5% mark and 30 minutes later it is 65 % so the One plus did good on the promise . The brick is beast of a charging plug.REFRESH RATE - ITS 90 Hz or nothing that's how fantastic that refresh is . 60Hz doesn't disappoint either  , the difference between the two is not too much but you definitely feel surfing a wave while sliding down and up it'll be a whole new time pass .lolCAMERA- nightscape mode and normal photo mode are super cool crisp and subtle pics to impress anyone . The pop up selfie camera gives a clean and cool selfie . So pop it like you work itOthers- no heating issues did play pubg on 90 Hz and qhd lasted me 3.5 hrs on what was the best pubg experience thus far . The only reason i reinstalled pubg after quitting it last year was to check the limits of the specs offered by the phone and it superceded it in everyway possibleCONS-BATTERY- 90 Hz and qhd will take a toll on your phone .battery life is disappointing kind of but given high end specs you get at this price plus the warp charge I think the company made its warp charging knowing that .With high end spec it lasts about 4-5 hrs extensive use like gamingWith 90hz and fhd about 5-6 he extensive to moderate use .60 hz and fhd -5-7.5 hrs with extensive to moderate useHANDLING-depends on your hands me being a 6'3 didn't find it difficult at all.CAMERA- even after the update the portrait mode is disappointing depth effect has played a spoil sport .NO DONGLE(SCREW YOU ONE PLIS FOR THAT ;). )NO HEADPHONE JACK (DOUBLE SCREW YOU)Overall go for it just the best experience this flagship has to offer in range of 49k to 53 k .NOTE - DO NOT REMOVE THE GLASS ON THE SCREEN THAT IS THERE BY DEFAULT IT IS THE BEST ONE YOU'VE GOT FOR A LONG WHILE WILL DO JUSTICE"
269,Do not peel off original screen protector that comes with phone.. reason is currently no screen guards are available and most of glass screen protectors dont work..Rest of the things as you already know.One less star because I received the piece with one noticeable scratch on the screen.Over all worth buying for sure.
270,"Where do i start! Ok one week down the lane, this phone to begin with looks spectacular, atleast from the screen and display point of view i dont know what could better this now. Next up, The 90hz refresh rate makes your phone feel buttery and you will love it(comes at a negotiable cost of reduced battery life) . It's alright though since it's powered with a WARP charger that works like a charm. Talking about cameras now, pop-up camera adds to the elligence of this phone. The picture qulities are stunning at times. I have tried macro photo graphy with this one and the details it can catch are just terrific to believe. 4k recording is excellent, stability is alright!! At this price (42k) it's almost unreal as to what this phone has to offer. Nebula blue color makes this gadget look like out of this planet. Let's not even get into specification. Because it's all just ""beyond the speed"". One amazing product!!"
271,"Speakers are good. Screen is good.But performance is getting worse.. Multitasking is impossible, if i open a notification and go back to previous opened app it starts all over again. Mi phones have better multi tasking than this i felt.If i get a phone call, and go back to opened app same happens."
272,I bought it few days ago and I am so impressed with it's performance.I am telling you all the things that I came across.Firstly I bought it at the price of 39999 rs.But I exchanged my old phone for which I got 4950 rs exchange .Thanks to OnePlus's 3000 extra cash back offer.I paid through sbi credit card and I received 2500 cash back instead of 2000.im surprised when I saw it.Firstly im talking about display.Display is so smooth and fluidy. 90 Hz refresh rate works amazing.I mostly life qhd instead fhz.Battery life is very good after update.Warp charger works very well.charges very quicky.Camera performance also great.Little bit improvement needed in front cam.Sliding mechanism also runs smoothly. detect fall very quickly.No lag issue found while playing heavy games.Little bit heating issue.but no worry about it.Curve glass looks premium.no disadvantages found.Oxygen os gives u such amazing experience that other os doesn't .So finally.My honest review.which I felt.{Display}  --  4.8/5{Camera}  --  4.5/5{Battery}.  --  4.5/5{Performance}  --  4.8/5{Looks}.  --  4.6/5{OS}.  --  4.9/5{Pubg}  --  4.8/5{Fin.scn}  --  4.8/5
273,"The phone is just wonderful! Although the phone was released almost exactly a year ago, it shows no sign of slowing down. The screen is just wonderful, and at its current price point, it's a bargain. Flagship quality for half the price. It misses out on very few features (like wireless charging, but I wouldn't really have used it with Warp Charge, so no complaints from me here) and the camera isn't the best (much better from when it was initially released, the camera captures everything quite naturally, if you give it good lighting though. Low light photography isn't great (especially compared to the iPhone 11 Pro, although that costs over twice what this one costs.) The screen is absolutely mesmerizing! Gets quite bright, but not the brightest. Not overally saturated, color reproduction is quite accurate. In-display fingerprint scanner is as fast as any normal fingerprint scanner, which is great news. OxygenOS is clean and beautiful. An awesome wrapper over android. No bloatware (except a couple of Oneplus Apps which come pre-installed, which are usually deletable). Overall, the best value for money right now (and for the near future as well). Do buy this over the Oneplus 7t or the 8!Enough said about the phone, the delivery process was quite disappointing. Amazon delivery agents don't know how to handle the exchange process. They have no idea how to navigate through the process specified, and wasted almost half an hour of my time, just to give me my phone. I've faced a similar issue with another phone I got delivered recently, and the experience this time around was even worse. Hope they change it soon."
274,"Let's start with the first thing that you would notice - size.It's a big phone, yeah. But, after 2 weeks you won't notice. It will feel just perfect in hand (if you don't use a cover on this). With a cover, it's still alright. And yeah, I've been using Galaxy S7 and Lg G7, meaning small phones, always. So yeah, size won't bother you and it feels as premium as a phone can get.Next, Display - I compared the display to S10, S10 Plus, Note 9, Pixel, iPhone. I love this display in every aspect. Everything will always look better. Maybe because of the larger size or actual display quality, I don't know. It's the best I've had. Outdoor visibility is a little less (only when you compare with others), but it will get the job done easily.Battery - Do not go through online review. It'll last a full day easily on heavy use. I'm getting a day and a half - 4 hrs Sot with 32-38 hrs or 7+ hours sot on weekends with a 18-22 hrs standby. Even it doesn't; You won't ever feel it. Charges in no time, Doesn't heats up while charging (even when you're using it). It's getting better after each day.Camera - Again, getting better after each update. I'm on android 10 open beta preview and you get all the features that you want. Every function enabled on each sensor. Default setting is great, detailed images, perfect balance. And, when you want to tweak, Pro mode is there. You don't need anything else when it comes to cameras. Btw, when comparing the pictures between S10 and 7 Pro, you'll like the 7 pro just cause of the display.Performance - Do I really need to review this? Just cut the animation scale to 0.5x in developer mode and it feels crazy. Not a single hiccup so far. This is the best performer in the industry.You won't get better experience than this. You may buy other flagships because you though the camers might be better or battery or blah blah. This the best thing in the market right now. Or, just wait for the 7T pro. 1 months maybe. Best thing ever.But, get a framless cover for 500, it will maintain the sleek feel of the phone. Don't try any uv screenguards, they are horrible. Use the stock screenguard or simple protectors.Cheers!"
275,The phone is super amazing.. It is a little heavy compared to other models from One Plus but that's not a complaint as the phone is real fast with great and simple features.. The finger print scanner is not that great as most of the times I have to input my password due to lockage from trying several times. I think they need to work a lot on this.. Camera quality is super good and even the night pictures turn out to be fabulous.Has a great battery life.. Based on my usage I'm getting around 12-15 hours.. But I need not to worry as the phone charges super quick.!Initially there were a few call drops but I think the issue is fine now..The best part about the phone is it's speakers! Dolby surround is just out of the World and you get a theater experience while watching videos or even music for that matter..OnePlus could have provided some basic headphones with this phone as it does not have a jack.. But i think you can get a good wireless headphone for around 2000 which will solve your problem..
276,"Seamless navigation, good low-light images and above all wonderful OS. A real flagship-killer.You can always research,review and compare but unless you use this phone or see anyone using it,you just can't comprehend the massive leap in class this phone brings in an average price-tag.Above all,you just can't have the best of everything but you can come close to eternity...that's OnePlus 7 Pro for you.Regarding delivery and packaging,Amazon never ceases to amaze and I candidly have never been so excited on seeing a package such smoothly arranged and sturdy being handed over.Besides, OnePlus has a tie-up with amazon.in and thus the product is genuine.(PS- Will add more images and a detailed review as I get time.)"
277,Waited 5 year to buy new phone after using Samsung note 3.Can say it was worth waiting.With this price tag and feature I consider this as perfect purchase.Main feature.Screen A+Speed SD 855Looks..even mirror grey look perfect90hz refresh rateBatteryDisappointedCameraScreen is quiet large
278,The worst experience. You can't play heavy games like PUBG and COD and even use Youtube for a long time because there comes over heating! They say there is a cooler inside.. But. I don't feel so. Screen keeps freezing while I play games due to this heating problem. Other apps keep closing automatically! I couldn't even share pics via WhatsApp cuz it started to load the pic forever! Still my hands are heating.. Never ever buy this crap.. go for a Samsung seriously.
279,"Was waiting for a good deal on S10, meanwhile OP7Pro was launched so I bought it on the first day it started selling, Amazon delivered the same day. Great service. I received and installed 2 updates, and having used it for a week plus, I can say it's been a mixed experience. Some features work well, others dont. So here's my impression for you.Good:1. Large and sharp LED screen with good legibility. Watching videos is fun. The on screen FP sensor is fast and conveniently located, no delays or misses.2. Dual speakers with clear sound, though music quality through speakers is just about OK.3. Fast and zippy, be it apps, games or file transfers. Doesnt get hot while playing games or charging4. Really fast charging. Fully charged in an hour!5. Oxygen OS is minimal and easy to use. The popup selfie camera is quicker than I expected.6. Haptic feedback is very refined. I used to turn it off on phones. On this one, it's on.The bad:1. The curved edges make it more slippery and the image on the edges reflect and appear distorted, any element there is hard to touch. Collects fingerprint marks easily. I dont find the missing notch makes any huge difference in my usage.2. There is no headphone socket on the phone, no USB-C headphone or adapter in the box3. The selfie camera is average, The rear triple camera setup isnt great as advertised. The main camera is good but gives inconsistent results.The Ugly1. Handling the phone because of it's weight, size and top heaviness, slipperiness.2. Battery life is a shame for a 4000mAh. Bringing down refresh rate and screen resolution made it a bit better, but it's still a one day phone at best.3. Wide angle lens is low on detail, not too wide yet creates distortion4. Not VFM at this price. Its should have been 6-8k cheaper for that.My impression is, this is a phone that only huge screen lovers should go for. The rest should wait for OP7, check if its battery life isnt as bad as this, and go for 8/256 version, still saving 11k over oneplus 7 pro. Else wait for s10/s10+ discount sale. I regret I didnt wait for S10 to be discounted."
280,forget about the teaser where oneplus7 is dropped in water. My oneplus7pro exposed to rain for 10 mins and it started flickering and screen damaged.Request all not to take that company video seriously and be careful in monsoon season avoid taking pics with such good camera
281,"Without a doubt this is yet another master piece from ONE PLUS. The only thing missing, which I think should have been included is the head phone jack. There are no cables in the one plus website as well and hence I had to buy one from a different vendor.Battery life is super good. When resource intensive apps aren't used, it can easily last for a day.Camera is better than previous versions.And the best add on is the stereo speakers. The list is long. I just love everything about the phone."
282,"Loving this phone.. Display is amazing, performance in mind blowing thanks to SD 855,.Feels a tad heavier because of the 5000 mAH battery especially since I have upgraded from OP 3T. Warp charge is ultra fast, but it does cause some heating which is expected..Overall feels a VFM phone."
283,"Over all it is a good phone. Upgrading from oneplus 3t to oneplus 7 Pro. Battery life is the best thing which I felt in this mobile. But there are a few problems with this phone which I encountered in nearly one month of usage.1) Fingerprint scanner not working sometimes :  I do not know whether it is happening to others as well, but when I try to unlock the phone, sometimes the fingerprint scanner is disabled and I have to use the pattern to unlock the screen. It happened a lot in this first one month of the usage.2) Camera is over beautifying the  pics taken. Most of the times when you click a photo, you looks over beautified than the actual person. The depth of the photo is getting compromised in this way. slightly dark colored people like me will get a shook  when you see the first photo of yourself. :D.  Also pics taken from the ultra wide lens are distorted when you zoom a little bit."
284,Amazing phone from OnePlus as always. Display is just buttery smooth. I bet you have never experienced such a smooth phone. Killer camera.Beautiful phone with a well programed software. Go for it without any doubt üëçüèª.
285,I bought this product because of series name 7 earlier I was using Oneplus 5 since last 2 n half year.After usage of one month .. here is my view.1. Camera is not good as they have done advertisement.2. Warp charging very fast.3. Heating hanging issue while you are using Facebook Live or Facebook Messenger.4. Selfie Camera is poor.5. Not value for money it should be around 42000 maximum  .6. Overall if you are one plus lover just wait for price drop in coming days because sale is not good of One plus 7 pro due to lots of issues and performance.
286,"One of the best phone i have ever bought. In fact i have been a fan of Oneplus since 3 years. My first phone from Oneplus was Oneplus 3 which is still performing amazing though it has been 3 years. Good thing about Oneplus 7 pro is it has got everything you need unlike the other phones which is cheap but comes with bloatware, which literally sucks. My rates are below.Camera - 9/10Speed - 10/10Sound - 10/10Resolution - 10/10Fingerprint and Face recognize - 10/10Over all - 10/10Also, the best part is i bought it when there was better offer available from Amazon, which was like 12,000. On top of this i spent about 1,500 for the screen protection which keeps it safe from the damage. Protection Pro which is made from rubber material mostly used by 3M works really well on your phones.Overall i am happy customer of amazon as well as OnePlus."
287,"After using a month Not worth it 50k, user experience is smooth but battery life is really disappointed it only last up to 3 to 4 hour if gaming 2.3 hour very bad warp charge is fake it almost take 1.3 hour even real me 3 pro charge faster it heat up while charging. Camera are not that good redmi note 7pro take same quality of image something even take a better pic than a 50k cellphone what the fcck wrong with oneplus image processing and video recording are not good in low light. Now all my frnd are trolling me is this 52k flagship cellphone .Zen mode is FCKINNNG useless my frnd use this to troll me they put without my permission there üò° should be password. AND MOST INTERESTING FOR A MONTH I COULD NOT USE MY FCCKNG EARPHONES BECAUSE THEY REMOVE HEADPHONE JACK AND THEY DON'T PROVIDE CONVERTER DOONGLE INSIDE THE BOX ALOTS OF COST CUTTING ONEPLUS. Buy it it won't disappoint you."
288,"Yes!!! After using this phone for around 2 months now, I have found it to be a pretty solid and a beast of a performer. The phone is snappy and pretty darn quick. The resolution is one of the best and the regular updates we get from OnePlus team is also admirable. Rest camera related opinions are always personal and not indicative of it's performance. Overall a pretty good option for those who want try out something new apart from the likes of The Samsungs, Huaweis..etc. No major or minor complaints."
289,Op7 Pro Pros:OMG üòç DISPLAY (Esp 90Hz)Good Battery lifeSimple UIFINGERPRINT scannerRegular software tweaksCons: worst cameraNo headphone jackOverall Future smartphone in hand only downside Camera
290,"Great phone. I wanted this phone to play pubg. It's buttery smooth! Love the haptic feedbacks, as of now it may only work for pubg. Battery life is not that good. But definitely not bad. The camera quality for a phone at this price range could have been better... Since this phone does not have 3.5 mm jack you can't charge and play. Either have to but the adapter or the One Plus Bullets. It's priced at 1,409/- which is definitely overpriced for it's slightly above average performance... I bought this phone for the display and the Snapdragon 855. If you don't mind the chin and notch you can definitely go for the Asus rog that's got better stats. But only if you're using it for gaming...."
291,Very nice phone OnePlus 7 ProI liked the lookI liked the cameraI liked the body colour nebula blueBattery could be better because it decreases with full features onIf you play games it will drain moreBut for normal daily use also battery is not enough at 90 hz. I'm charging twice daily.I felt bad for no earphone and no premium hard back cover were provided in the box although transparent cover was givenBut in the end it's nice to have oneplus latest mobile phone
292,"Thank you Amazon for the fast delivery, before ordering oneplus7 pro I had read comments, mostly negative comments but still ordered it, I got phone next day and when opened it start the screen I fall in love withs phone, great affort put by OnePlus company for making such beautiful mobile phone, it's fast, charging is super fast, graphics is excellent, all set phone, guys you all must buy this phone and get fabulous experience."
293,"awesome product,really beyond the speed...clone my old one plus phone with nebula blue.. with in 15 min..all data transfer.. by one plus switch..stylish star... macho look.... brilliant..for one plus.. in bocca al lupo for future endeavours..."
294,"The good The OnePlus 7 Pro is fast, has a neat pop-up camera and its triple rear cameras take fantastic pictures -- all at very less than its closest Samsung and iPhone rivals.It's screen is made by Samsung but Samsung itself doesn't have that screen90hz display is a gem in this phone after using this phone you can't use any other 60hz phonesThe bad OnePlus' new phone is heavy and isn't rated for water resistance. It lacks wireless charging and a headphone jack.The bottom line The OnePlus 7 Pro's camera, performance and price make it the go-to premium Android phone of 2019."
295,Am cutting one star for not having any headphone jack also the OnePlus wireless earphones are too high.Regarding other performance so far so good you can go for it.
296,Delivery was very satisfying. I received the product in just one day.Oneplus 7pro nebula blue 12 gb with 256 gb.Pro.As everyone stats its buttery n super speed.Charges very fast.ConsCamera needs a major update.On the first time of use from the box n while charging the mobile was pretty much heated.At least a converter for Head phones should be provided.
297,Don't buy. Very bad experience with oneplus 2nd time.One plus 7 pro has heating problem. It gets heated without even using it. Gets heated when on charge. Gets heated while paying game. Feels like it will brust.I bought one plus 2 3 years back it has the heating problem so i sold that. Now when i bought one plus 7 pro again it has the same problem. Infact i have replaced my previous one plus seven pro and the one which i got and using now has the same problem of heating. You can't use it continuously as it gets heated so much. Charging is fast. Battery life is ok. Processing is fast. Camera is good. But what's the point of spending 49k if yiu cant use is properly. Thanks.
298,Mobile is good. After 4months usage I am giving this review. I received good product without any problem and damage. Mobile function is good till now. But only problem is with screen guard. There is offline screen guard available for this screen. And no mobile service shops are putting screen guard.If possible include screen guard along with mobile.
299,"I bought this mobile by listening someone words like one plus is wonderful and I faced few draw backs in this mobile which are primarily battery draw back( kept charge twice a day with playing games and videos as well), mobile got too much heat and also taking long time to change battery, mobile is too weight as well and also not sharing minimum internet speed other devices such as laptops and other mobiles as well and very poor security settings found in this mobile. These are the problems that I have faced with in 15 days around. Please check before purchase this product. Waste of money to purchase this product I guess‚òùÔ∏è"
300,"Writting this after using 1.5 months.Pros are1. built quality2. premium look3. warp charging4. camera is much better after many updates5. Stunning Display (qhd+ resolution & 90hz refresh)6. Performance (Speed, speed, speed.....)7. Very good Speakers8. Faster fingerprint sensor9. No heating issue10. Smooth UICons1. Feels bulky in hand(hard to use in one hand)2. Weight3. Not bad battery life4. Double tap wakeup misbehaves (while holding in hand wakes the display even when not double tappped)5. Proximity sensor (since placed on top, it malfunctions during call)6. No notification led"
301,"Phone is nice i got yesterday delivered, however nice camera with better zooming refresh rate with 90 hertz makes a best feel to hand on, this is my first oneplus product..and yeyyii i m enjoying it well"
302,"Happy to buy next oneplus flagship killer oneplus 7 Pro....Fingerfrint sensor :  its working very smooth, unlocked in less than a second.Camera quality: its really best with all features and specially the pixel quality, people have to understand that it show you real image with no addon pixel colour as other phone didBattery life: people have to understand the battery life depends upon the use if u used 24*7 then all phones battery will drain but for generally use it is really best"
303,"I bought this phone on first day of launch. My views :Pros :- Display quality is amazing & enjoying it- Speed is extremely good- Camera is very good- Some of the features are good in this modelCons :- Battery life is not good. Need lot's of improvements in battery optimization- In adaptive brightness the screen brightness doesn't change automatically (even if you set it) many a time. You have to manually switch the adaptive brightness off & then on, then the screen will change the brightness. This might be a bug, which OnePlus needs to resolve- In the new pc received I found bubbles on screen guard provided- Weight of the product is highUsing it for more than 15 days now & I am loving it inspite of few negative points, being a OnePlus lover. But the company has to improve the product in many ways & we expect the updated in the near future."
304,Very smooth and buttery.....I am a big fan of OnePlus phones and the performance of this phone completely blown me off.....Good Job OnePlus team.....keep it up....üëç
305,Simple good at these price segment i will be waiting so long to get it but whrn i get these phone in lockdown after 2 months the waiting worth these productsAbout phoneIt's all about display.... those who wnat best display must go for it... you definitely observed get different in between rog 2 and OP 7 pro ya  you sacrifices more battery and air trigger bt you got more in these phone water resistant and and camera get huge difference in both
306,"Pro:- Display- Performance- Great in display fingerprint reader- Awesome fnatic mode for gamers- Zen mode for the ones who uses phone too much- Great low light photography- Great camera quality (after recent update)- Really nice portrait mode- Super fast wrap charging- The pop-up camera, one must admit it's pretty cool- heptic feedback makes gaming experience better for supported app.- great stereo soundCons:- Battery life is not great but the super fast wrap charging compensate that.- Some times photos are not great, might need some tweaking to get that great shot."
307,"Awesome and excellent phone....Delivery is quick in 2 days..The only con is it is a bit heavy.. But the fantastic screen makes u forget about that...And u need to use a case. As it is heavy if it falls accidentally there are more chances of getting damaged..Regarding charging 30w charger is superb..Battery draining is not so fast.. An average user can get a ful day charge easily...I don't use camera much... I used Asus zenfone 5z and LG v30 plus previously both are flagship phones at that time. But the camera quality is very nice here compared to both of them..Fingerprint reader is also fast and smooth.. I don't use face unlock bcoz it takes a little time and need to swipe to get the pop up camera open..Got a transparent case in the box.. It is of good quality but it doesn't give a good look to ur mobile. So better to buy a back cover online..Display is very smooth.. Watching movies and videos Is awesome... It's very bright and got no problems in watching under direct sunlight..Not too many customizations we can find here in oxygen os..Coming to stereo speakers, they are good and decent but not as loud as zenfone 5z..As there is no headphone jack I had ordered Bluetooth earphones.. They are on the way and had to use them to write review about sound quality..Played PUBG and other big games without any lag.. Runs very smooth.. As it is 12GB ram all the games and apps we use they Wil be in the ram without getting closed..The phone may gets heated up definitely if we use camera for more time or play non stop games.. That Wil be very common with any mobile..You need to be very careful as it is very heavy it is slippery too.. So u need to definitely use a case for that..My final verdict is if you don't have problem with it's weight then it is the best flagship phone right now in the market at this price.. Lack of wireless charging and headphone jack is not a problem to me.. It has the best screen till now..Am writing now after 20 days of use now.. I observed it's hanging sometimes when playing some small games which I did not get any prblm with big games. I don't know why.. Despite of having 12gb ram why it's hanging.. I hope it Wil be resolved in future updates..And one more thing is proximity sensor is not working properly a lot of times during calls leading to accidental touches which is irritating.. Hope everything Wil be solved in future updates..Thank you..."
308,"I am using OnePlus phone since last 4 years and it was 5th OnePlus phone in my whole family. But this time, looks like either I have received Defective phone OR refurbished phone.1. Phone doesn't get silent even if I turn Silent mode ON.2. Battery gets consumed so quickly even if phone is not in use.3. Charging is not at per WRAP technology.4. Sometimes, phone goes off network even Network shows full. Have to do Flight mode ON/OFF to get network activated.5. Touch on screen is not that much responsive as OnePlus phone should be.6. Speaker mode goes on Hang state.Request OnePlus team to please replace my handset."
309,phones great!-2stars for Amazon delivery.phone box had dents all around.Amazon prime delivery was used to be good now it isn't. it was a late delivery too!.
310,Display is so fragile tat it broke with small touch they say it's gorilla glass and even then it's fragile ... I gonna complaint in consumer court regarding this the coustomer care people say it's gorilla glass warranty not covered for it u HV to bare complete amount for it ... If it is so then why they HV mentioned it gorilla glass or I might have got defective piece then
311,Very dissapointing from oneplus8gb ram is in the phone but still there is a problem of bug and freezes mainly while u taking a lots of call and the 2nd largest issue is network .while call its ok but while using internet the connection get lost after using of one or half hour then you have to restart the phone or doing flight mode on/off for restart of internet3rd thing is its software improvement there is more features  in mi phone under 15k phone than one plus 7 pro specially its fingerprint lock remove option from individual appsI have bought two phone of varient 8gb ram or 256 gb memory but the phone is not the value of money its totally waste of money
312,It's blazing fast... Solid build.. better than rivals..90hrts...consumes lots of battery....Bit pricey considering the brand.. But its not  a big deal.
313,Its a good phone to use. If you were a premium phone user from before you will not find any difference. Only differnce you might find is the display and camera because of pixels and refresh rate.You cannot use the phone if you are wearing a good quality gloves
314,"Wroth for money,the camera is awesome. The battery life and charging is next level.it has all the best quality which need to be in smart phone. The best smart phone of the year."
315,"Writing this review after 2 months of my purchase. If you are looking for a beast with with best battery , fluid amoled screen experience along with top notch processing speed. There is no other options. Go blindly to this üòçüòçü§ó. I can surely say 1 thing you are not gonna regret for buying this mobile i bought a 8/256 model for 40k including bank offers. Worth for every penny üíØüíØüíØ"
316,"Camera Quantity very dispointed me very bad when campare to my one plus 6TNo clarity photos very sad,Especially potriet mode it crops and zoomy and also sheks,48mp it's only in pro mode  not in default mode,3x zoom Very bad its not worthy no clearty photos also.Battery life ok ok not upto the markWe r giving almost 50k it's not worthy for this phone"
317,"It's a beast!!!!!!! Believe me...... Being an apple lover , never thought about Android giving such smooth performance, battery life,superb display, good camera & such a stylish phone at all...... Just happy to use this.....(iPhone x user)"
318,"This is my second OnePlus after using OnePlus 3 for a couple of years. Battery life is so good that I don't have to worry about charging the phone with extensive use. OnePlus lacks a lot when it comes to Camera performance, though 7 pro Cameras are much better than OnePlus 3, still they lack the performance expected of mobile cameras.Apart from the camera, it is a great phone to use."
319,"This product proves to be a flagship in everyway although it doesn't offer some of many features in other mainstream phones, it more than keeps up with and actually overcomes such phone's ""limitations"" this is a really innovative phone with some unique features but it also lacks to offer comfortability in many cases such as one handed use is very hard because of its weight and thickness. Phone gets hot if I play games like pubg in QHD+ and 90hz display mode with fnatic mode one(it is a built in feature to improve gaming experience and it does improve noticeably my 8n game frame rate reduced 10ms) and gets really hot if I play two more games and it burns through battery. The battery life otherwise is pretty good easily lasts a ""day"" (more than 7 hours) with normal to heavy usage (I use it with screen turned on for 6 hours with half brightness 90hz and FHD+ display with volte data ebabled, in that 6 hours 3 hours of continuous online gaming 2 and half hours of watching online videos while traveling and the remaining 1 hour just aimlessly scrolling the refresh rate is something else). Camera quality is something else especially the video I prefer to take snapshots from video if I should be taking videos like in a concert or something but the low light camera performance is a little disappointing because it doesn't have motion capture and the evening images look shaky because of it and also the lens is affected by stray lights leaving a lens flare often which would be cool with sunlight but street light and reflection of tubelight from a puddle of water can be really annoying. I would've really liked if we could choose various lenses for video but it seems to capture video from the main lens onle. Charging is amazing, it is exactly as advertised so do check the promotion video. No screen protector from oneplus although thier cases are good. I would recommend u buying a 3.5 mm jack adapter because no bluetooth headphones are worth it if you play a lot of games like me ( bluetooth latency is a beach) not even aptx low latency headphones can compete with your gaming if you turn on fnatic mode. Audio quality and clarity is great but output volume is a little low in bluetooth speaker and headphones in phone speakers are almost good as a TV but much crisp and clearer. Final points I'm using this phone for the last 2 months it is a lot of fun and useful but a pain to hold it for more than 20 mins because of the thickness, design and weight phone is really slippery despite the weight and looks I would recommend a good case from oneplus itself."
320,"Waste of money only speed,  Changing speed also not good same like oneplus 6 ,fingerprint is less secured open using some tricks, camera is too poor for money"
321,"This is an excellent product by one plus.. When I ordered it, I got scared by one star review by many people.. I think it was wrote by competitors.. Happy n proud.. Really"
322,Pros :1. Display is outstanding.Never seen a display like this in any phone till now .2. Performance is top notch.3. Speakers are mind blowing . Feels like holding a home theatre .Cons.1. Battery is draining too fast due to display QHD + and 90 hz refresh rate .2. Camera is not that of a hype .Overall best phone to buy keeping the price and specs in mind . Very satisfied üòÑ
323,"Well well, in simple word description: KillerEverything in this phone is top class.Camera quality is brilliant and performance is next level.Motorized camera is very responsive.As of know i didn't find any glitch in this phone."
324,"The main reason why i bought this phone is my old C9 Pro broke and i needed a phone with good Display which can support HDR 10,Then i gone with the hype and finally bought this phone.but i got the problem with the display itself üò™ I wanted a phone with a gud display when i didn't get whta i want for so what do i do with the rest of the specs.After playing any 4K/HDR content ylloew color is appearing on the whole screen even when i put the screen calibration ""Cold"".And when i on the reading mode its worse ....all dispaly is seems like someone spreaded Turmeric Powder on it & its not bright as many samsung's phones.i have been using my old samsung c9 pro for 3yeras and i knw it.Being a movie lover i luv watching movies in my phone. Totally disappointed with the display.OnePlus should update thier dispaly next time with more brighter screen."

326,This mobile is awesome in looks wise as well as performance wise.if you are looking for a premium range mobile than this is a best choice.worth buying.
327,"I have been using 8GB variant for 3 months.Before this one  , i had OP 5t. 5t never had heating issues whereas this phone gets heated with continuous use.The only pros of upgrading to 7pro from 5t is quality of display , bezel less display , screen size. But 7 pro is not up to the mark in terms of camera performance. Below average camera. It sometimes clicks good picture under good light conditionsMost of the times i use FHD+ display to save battery and i hardly switch to QHD+ which doesn't really make much difference.Finger print reader is fine. Not as fast as 5t that may be because of in display finger print reader.Overall this mobile is okay if you are not a camera enthusiastic.But personally i don't find it to be a worthy upgrade from op5t."
328,"Though I liked the phone very much, I was shocked to note that there was no User Manual. I checked online too but not available online too. When I contacted Oneplus for the same, I was informed that manual must be inside the box or I should contact Amazon from where I bought the phone. Unfortunately I can not find a way to contact Amazon and as a result, I am not in a position to use my Phone fully."
329,Phone is really good. Beautiful display and fast. One plus nailed it with this phone. Camera though is wanting a bit. Starts blurring when you zoom.The other big area of let down is the finger print recognition... It is very average. Many a times it doesn't even recognize the fingerprint. The face recognition is good but there is a little lapse as the camera had to pop out. This biometric aspect is no where close to the one plus 6.
330,"I have purchase 8 GB varient on 24-06-19 and within 3 or 4 days I found following defects :-1. Battery backup is very poor. It drains very fast.2. OnePlus claimed super strong conactivity, but according to me it is only satisfactory.3. Cost of this product is very high.4. I contacted customer care within 4 days of purchase for replacement. But they refused.So guys if you want to purchase costly phone. Think deeply about the negetive side. So please read all customers reviews carefully and then finalise. Once product received, you can't do anything."
331,"Well, there is nothing to dislike about this device. I own the 8GB Ram version of OnePlus7Pro. But, OnePlus could‚Äôve delayed the launch of OnePlus7TPro. Within a couple of months, your phone is no longer the flagship even though the device was launched less that 3 months ago of my purchase.Note:1. Camera is above average but not among the flagships of other brands.2. Display is amazing. I‚Äôve not experienced anything like it before.3. Just received an update for Android 10.4. OnePlus needs to reconsider gap between launching flagship devices."
332,"Really fastest mobile in the world ... Stunning camera . Good stability at high zoom .. water-resistance . Awesome battery with fast warp charge.ultra level display , really more smooth .. gaming fnatic -mode is really impressive for gaming. Dolby sounds can feel u like in cinema. Fastest finger print unlock ever... Compared iPhone and Samsung , OnePlus 7 pro is really at the best price"
333,People write review instant after they buy and use the product for few days. But this review is coming after 8 months usage of One Plus 7Pro. I had One Plus 5 earlier and so I thought of going with 7Pro. I would say this phone is no match for the earlier version. This phone hangs a lot and updates are pathetic. Seems like One plus is trying to do too much on this phone or something is wrong that they are not able to fix.  Though it iss said to be their fastest phone but I find non reason on why it hangs or freeze.After using this phone my confidence on higher models is shaky. So don't go with the wave of impressive advts. Check for the real user reviews.Camera was better in One Plus 5. You need to edit the pics clicked indoors to make them brighter and colourful.Battery life is just okay but you need to keep your brightness in control.Design is good but that's not the only thing that you would buy an expensive phone for.If with 80GB storage space as balance it starts lagging or freezing then what happens if the you are low on space like 10GB. It was almost unusable when it was that low on storage. I had to clean it out. So even if you buy a 256 GB phone just make sure you have enough storage left.This is my personal view and points. Use your own judgement and knowledge to evaluate the phone.
334,"Must buy this phone if you have a budget of 50K around- Camera excellent- Performance in gaming- Haptick feedback while gaming- Large 4K screen with 4k recordingJust the battery is a problem a big battery is ultimately used bu big display, but WRAP charging comes to rescue here.Ever thought your phone is watching you, not with this one as it has hidden front camera üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
335,"Only 1 word its just ""AWESOME""I read some negative reviews for camera performance, but im really very happy with the camera n will give it a 5*. Only the thing i didnt like is the scratch guard and back cover provided is so cheap in quality"
336,"One plus 7 Pro is truly a beautiful phone just fell in love with the phone when I got my hands on it, I'm using the phone since 2 days, I want to say a lot of positive things about the phone but I'll make it short, this phone exceeds my expectations in all aspects, just go for it, a great buy, I'll highly recommend it."
337,"Simply a worthy premium smartphone for daily use. Have been using it for almost 4+ months. 90Hz display is amazing and smooth (one of my favourite these days). On screen fingerprint is fast enough for unlocking the phone. Unfortunately, i didn't used face unlock and i didn't use front camera often. So no comments on that.With 30W Warp Charge, the 4000mAh battery can be recharged pretty fast as well (as per the company's claim and its working excellent so far).Camera is working as expected and also tried few nightmode shots and it is also satisfying.No troublesome heating issues found so far.There is no headphone jack, but i don't have any problem with that as I am using OnePlus Bullet Wireless 2 (Excellent choice for OnePlus7Pro).Ps:- This is my first OnePlus company's product and I simply loved everything about it."
338,"I got this for 46k after offer also got 1 year screen replacement guaranty free, so accordingly, this phone is value for money.Pros -1 Looks are great2 Camera provide enough details as needed3 Fingerprint sensor is damn fast as  compared to samsung ultrasonic fp reader.4 popup camera motor is fast and i sometime miss to see popup while it unlocks phone with face unlock.5 battery at Qhd resolution 90 htz display provide 4.5 hours screen on time (a day usage including standby), Qhd 60 htz provide 5.5 hours and Full Hd 60 htz provide 6 hours Screen on Time. On an average i get a full day usage easily.6 weight distrubution is excellent that phones doesn't feel heavy in hand.Cons:low light camera performance is ok ok."
339,"Interested in returning and getting a refundA lot of issues with One plus 7 Pro...1) Ghost touches- the touch screen acts wierd sometimes and apps open up and closes automatically.2) Delayed Response- while making calls, there is quite a long delay one I click call option. Sometime feels like the touch is not working and suddenly after 10-15 sec or more, the phone goes into calling mode.3) Voice disturbances-many instances, when the call is made, voice is not transmitted.4) CAMERA- even after the update the back camera is still blurred. Indoors it take decent photography but not up to the mark of a flagship killer (as these are called). The focus is bad. In potrait (depth) mode background is not blurred.I have been following OnePlus community forums and these problems are common all across. Also different people are getting different issues.Would really like to get money back. But the option for refund or replacement wasn't available initially and now it shows refund period closed on 30th may. Looks like a cheap stunt to force the products on the consumers."
340,"Display is so delicate my frnds display broken cost 17000, frnds if you purchase, take one assist insurance or use templered glass and screen guard on it, and a good quality backcover, since it is a curved display more chances of braking if front glass also breaks then also full scrren to be replaced"
341,"It's been 3 days that I got my hands on this beast. So far fully satisfied with Screen, Finger Sensor, Wrap charging, Processing etc. Camera could have been a little better for this price range.  While zooming there are litter blurred pics and front camera definitely could use some improvement. But over all worth it's price. Go for it !!!!!!!!!"
342,"Better than s10 and iPhone xs at this price.Screen on this device is LIT.And yes normal users will experience the difference between 90Hz and 60Hz.About battery i get an avg SOT of 7.30hrs.Warp charging is best in the market,almost charges upto 50percent within 20mins.Only one thing which is a little bit downside is the camera.Which i am sure will be upgraded with future software updates."
343,"Best flagship till now üòéhappy to have this phone! camera is gud but it can be best by software update .I love the night mode ,screen is superb .so smooth"
344,It is easy to grade on the performance but it is very deficult to explain.Simply Beyond IMAGINATION S.  in all aspects on the concepts of a mobile phone. Congratulations ONEPLUS.
345,Excellent phone.. Superb Camera.. Extraordinary screen.. super smooth touch feel.. only one thing about charging is the wrap charger is nothing different than the Dash charger it takes the same time as dash one.. Overall a great phone for a Good price..
346,Happy with the phone one plus delivered its promise and the few bug fix n patch update  makes it still smooth no lags even in heavy games and screen response is beyond compare the display clarity is beyond compare I stream Netflix  content n prime love yo watch.. the battery last till 50% in normal mode  when saver mode its super  cool when u adjust the refresh rate and optimised use...Gaming mode is added  cool stuff ...
347,"A very crisp and sharp fluid AMOLED FHD+ screen with 90HZ refresh rate. The best u can get in the Market.The camera is good , pictures are sharp but does lack some features like wide angle option for selfie.The battery drains fast if you use it in the highest resolution but with battery saver you can really use the phone well. It does give you options to change the resolution to save the battery if you are not into battery saver.The phone is a little heavy and big if you are used to lighter phones but you'll get used to it.Well it's OnePlus , it's absolutely worth the money."
348,"Using this phone for more than 7 moths now but this one still feels the same in terms of smoothness as day one. Quality of each part in intact till date. And I just can't get enough of its Display. It's a treat to eyes.I must say that this is the best phone that I have ever used and one of the most satisfying purchases I have ever made.In future, may be after 4-5 years, when I will reflect back I will be proud of myself that I had held and used this phone in past. :)Keep making amazing products Oneplus. You guys are game changers."
349,"Awesome phone. To start with pros, amazing design and the color nebula blue is nice. Camera quality is good for the price, never settle with the speed. Face unlock is slow as the pop up camera needs to open up and read the face and unlock also fingerprint is slow compared with OP6. Great phone for reasonable price."
350,"Been using it since launch, battery life is absolutely fantastic and so is the display. However, the camera or its software leaves much to be desired.If I cared about the absolute best image quality, I would not pick this phone. But I don't, and I agree with the majority in stating that no other phone has gone through a whole day with me (except perhaps the P30 Pro) and I would definitely recommend this phone."
351,Demerits Very heavy it weighs like a powerbank.Low light camera is not up to the mark compared to oppo f11.Wide angle videos not supported.No headphone jack nor a connector in box which is very bad.Pricing toooooo much.MeritsWarp charging is superbBattery backup is also good but not up to the mark.Front camera is unimaginably good.Gestures and performance are excellent.
352,"There is a issue with pixels of display , when ever you play any video which has low light kind of dark videos then a greenish flash is blinking up on the screen.i visited the customer and they do know that issue is there in specific to one plus 7 pro series but no help provided. Worst service by op service"
353,"The display is the key point which outrage this phone. I just brought this phone for it's display. It feels too smooth & the 90Hz display is way better than u think. Since it's a curved display & huge display with no notches on it you have to be a bit careful in handling it. If you are a bit rough handler then you need to think twice before buying, but if you are a soft user as me then if budget is not a constraint then this is the right phone at this price point."
354,"This product is really nice. Really strong camera on the back and awesome features embaded in a phone. Purchased this at the time of launch and since then it has been an awesome gaming and video experience. Only thing is that they could have worked a little better on the night mode and on the quality of front camera. Apart from this no complaint, a truely awesome product."
355,My god this phone is a wet dream for many tech savvy people out in the world. you can get better camera in iphones...better utility options in samsung....better hardware in ROG phones by asus....BUT YOU CAN GET THEM ALL IN THIS BEAST. This is all you need for a phone that can obliterate any and every flagship phones in the market. This phone completes your desire for an ultimate phone . Trust me...THIS IS BEST YOUR MONEY CAN BUY YOU IN ANDROID RIGHT NOW.
356,"Hai, After using 15 days, Phone is okBut battery drain very fast. Photos are good.The person who use more incoming and outgoing calls... This phone is not advisable..Finally I am not Happy with this Mobile."
357,"I ordered as soon as was available. The phone looks beautiful, feels premium. The letdown begins when u start using it for a while. The fingerprint reader was easy enough to setup. But upon usage had issues. it didn't work all the time. Lots of time the phone would just keep saying too many attempts & keep asking for pin. The pop up camera started having weird rubbing noise Everytime it was used.the phone calls had weird static distortion in them while they were quite clear on my iphone. I think they will release an update to fix it. The edges of the screen with the curve e resistance to touch and since the corners of the screen r more rounded than others, lots of time functionality was cut off. Like the voice message button in WhatsApp. The screen looked great with the 90hz display but unresponsiveness killed all the fun. It dosent matter if the screen is good . It might have a higher refresh rate but will still feel slow if the responsiveness is low. The camera quality was the most dissapointing aspect. Coming from iPhone the difference was quite apparent. The images seemed more granier and more saturated. The 3x zoom is underwhelming. Will probably install the pixel camera software as the stock software just dosent match up. But then the pixel phones have the best camera processing in the smartphone world.The battery is fine not great, but that was to be expected with the quad hd 90hz display. Roughly lasts 8to 9 hrs on average usage for me. Warp charge is a boon.Overall the price increase for the pro version does not seem to be justified. Too many trade-off. The one plus 7 which is not getting as much attention is a much better phone and more value for money. The difference in value proposition seems negilible between the two."
358,"Screen : It's really awesome.. 90Hz is silky smooth..Charging Speed : It does charge 50% inside 20 mins..Battery Life : 1.5 - 2 Days battery life for my usage.. It depends upon your usage..Camera : I don't take selfie or photos that much, so can't comment on it..Performance : It is really really fast..Sound : I do watch a lot of my content on YouTube i do feel the speakers are not that clear.. They are loud but not clear(Maybe it can be improved by changing the some setting or solve it in the next updates)My review : Overall i loved the phone.. If you are a normal usage phone person, then you will definitely love the phone b'coz of its 90Hz screen.. Some user will change the display setting to 60Hz, but if you start using it on 90Hz then there no way you will go back to 60Hz..Pros : As per my usage..#1 - If you use it for 30 mins and then take some another phone, you will not like the other phone.. You will fall in love with the display and once you start using it daily, you will not touch any other phone..#2 - Phone has a 1440 x 3120 pixels resolution and huge screen size, so if you watch a lot of content on your phone, You will love it..#3 - Performance is really fast..#4 - Definitely whole day battery life.. (1.5 day for me)Cons : As per my usage..#1 - As the screen size is huge, it is very difficult to use the phone in one hand.. You cannot type while chatting with one hand..#2 - Finger print sensor - I keep my phone inside my bag while driving, the screen wakes up so many times.. Accidental screens wakes up a lot..(Hope they solve this issue in next updates)#3 - Sometimes some apps do crash.. (It may be the choice of app i may use)"
359,"Pros: 1. 90 hz (it takes you to another world)  2. Ui speed awesome  3. Charging speed mind boggling.  4. Haptic feedback best in class.  5. Sound quality of speakers awesome  6. A big thanks for the speed of phone.CONS: 1. Poor battery backup (battery drains rapidly)  2. Camera just an average (it kills originality of photos, make face a bit pinkish.)Don't know when one plus camera are going to justify it's price.  3. Handsfree/Bluetooth earpods sound below average. Didn't expected this from one plus.Tried different components handsfree /earpods same result.  3. Weight management very poor.  4. As phone is huge in size, functionality should be at bottom of phone. I hope one plus will do something."
360,"'nuff said. If you still have doubts, check the hundred or so review videos praising how good this device really is. If you are in the market for a premium phone but don't want to pay the Apple Tax or Samsung Tax, just got with this phone.Note: if waterproofing is not important for you, consider Asus 6Z as well for a much lower price."
361,"I bought OnePlus 7 Pro(6GB, Mirror Gray)  from Amazon on 4 October 2019 in 'Amazon Great Indian Sale.Seller Name - Rocket Kommerce LLPOn 9 Oct, my Phone delivered and I was doing the initial setup.Suddenly an error occurred that showing ""Android Setup Keeps Stopping"" and Nothing happens. I stucked on this error screen. after restarting many times I did a factory reset and able to get home-screen.1.  After getting an error on Brand New Phone on initial setup, I am assuming that this phone is tampered by the seller and contains fake parts.2. when I ran speed test(Read&Write) of internal storage. The results are way less than actual ufs 3.0 storage even half.read & write speed is same as ufs 2.1. It means internal storage is tampered or defective.after this whole incident, I am very disappointed by Amazon."
362,"PROS:Great Displayprocessor SD 855Oxygen OSNice duel speakersGood cameraLower sar value (head:1.187w/kg, body:0.606 w/kg)HIgh amount of ram for great gaming experienceGood screen on time without using higher refresh rate or higher resolution.Wrap charger support for fast chargingUFS 3.0 Supports for faster file transfersCONS:No 3.5 mm headphone jack supportBattery capacity is low for max resolution and 90 hz displaySignal reception is not good like oneplus 6T"
363,"Undoubtedly this beauty deserves 5 stars without any doubt..! Man you got excellent camera with very good low light conditions, excellent picture Clarity in daylight and super selfie camera. Performance is top notch. 855 SoC is killing it. You got 90hrz refresh rate and 4k display wherein you can shoot and stream true 4k content with an ease which no other phones in this price segment can do. Battery life is good, as I'm fond of games, I play a lot of games and I'm satisfied with battery life. Special mention pop up camera- that stress test in YouTube which is for 12hrs straight clears everyones doubt on pop up cam. It is just perfect ."
364,I like the phones but mostly dislike missing 3.5mm jack battery drain very fast. And in the box only normal  case cover is there and no protection on display screen it's just coated with plastic strips. Atleast provide screen guard glass in the box.. and the main thing is that no screen guard available in the market.
365,"First time I have purchased one plus phone (one plus 7 pro) received on 30.November.19  but my experience is very bad due to phone camera quality . Pictures are blur and camera can't focus on subject, pictures showing good in camera before clicking but after click picture goes blur. Camera quality is not up to mark as per price range. There are problem of Slow motion video recordering as blanking problem. Picture clearty of 3 camera is poor. finally worst camera quality....Avoid to Buy this ...."
366,"I watched the release event of the OnePlus 7 Pro and it is masterpiece!!The specs of the phone are amazing and the 90hz display is a top notch to mobile phone.Fingerprint sensor's recognition time is toooo low! You can unlock the phone before Thanos snaps... It's that fast.The triple camera system is spectacular too... it's like a mini DSLR in your pocket.Overall, I just loved the phone! I really recommend it!"
367,Phone heats up when put for charge and this phone is not fit for gaming at all I'm just scared that this device may explode one day while playing games cause it heats up so much.I'm sure there are other phones in the market that gives better performance for much cheaper price than this device. Overall very dissapointed with the device after all the so called adds they did for promoting this device. If you really care about your money don't go for this device.
368,Verry slow speed by one plus this time.  The demo first then buy
369,Camera quality is very bad. Dissoppointed.Apart from this everything good. A bit heavy.
370,Awesome product ...again One plus shows it's class and master peice of workmenship. Totally it feels great in hand...1. Design ...very good2. Battery life... Heavy use 10 hrs3. Camera Quality ...Best I have ever seen in this range of phone..4. RAM and ROM.  As per specification work5. Processor ...Actually very fast and with any lagging .In short I m very much satisfied with this phone after using approx one month.
371,"Received the product today. Absolutely mind blowing. Battery back up, display, camera etc everything is perfect. If budget is not a concern then can go for it. Thanks to Amazon for an perfect delivery."
372,"My primary purpose of buying this phone was to buy a phone with premium finish and a good battery. I dont use the camera much, neither I play games.battery charges really fast, but this monster also guzzles it fast, so not able to hold the battery life longer."
373,"For those complaining  about display and camera issue. Trust this review.I've been an avid user of Samsung from the last 5 years and I've had all of their flagships. This was my first time with One Plus and I am surprised that it surprises me in all departments.. That flamboyant display with a cheeky 90hz is something ppl say is not noticable...Trsut me the absolute feel of that is beautiful.Gaming is undeniably the best from the best in this segment.Camera is great with the patches all of its issues are fixed and going forward many more patch updates will hopefully just make it better.. Stabilization is on point. The audio captured on the videos is great quality.Speed is absolutely is blazing fast... Yes it is going to face a challenge from the likes of redmi k20 pro. But it is a one plus end of the day and am 100% sure display is where k20 pro is not going to win. Also software optimization and camera is better any day on the op7 pro...Lastly, it is not about the best phone. It is about the brand value and what that can do as justice to the options you favor."
374,I am reviewing this smartphone after 1 month of usage. Battery standby is my only concern rest are all awesome.Pros:1) Display2) Stereo Speakers3) In-display fingerprint4) WARP ChargeCons:1) Battery stand-by could be improved2) Camera not up to the mark(but OnePlus is doing their best)
375,Don't believe negative reviews  every thing is superb this is my 4th mobile from 1+.... Only one thing is little bit heavyweight
376,This phone is over hyped. I had lots of expectations. I ordered twice. But not happy using this product. OnePlus is not able to meet the expectations of mine. I am trying to refund or replace with Samsung S10
377,"First thing first, this is a Supreme Phone.I got this 8Gb/256Gb version for 40999 ( there were some other offers also - SmartBuy By HDFC made it even a better deal - 2000 worth vouchers more) . This phone justifies the price of 40K. It beats the Samsung and iPhone hands down in Display and aesthetics. Camera is tad bit inferior to Iphone Pro Max and Note 10 but the difference is marginal. Normal user will find it hard to notice the difference. Night Mode has been great with the latest software on.And yes, the User experience is better than Iphone. It took all these years for and Android phone to trump Apple in that regard. 90Hz refresh rate is not a gimmick, it makes every other mobile phone 'feel' slow.Battery life is great, lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage , even with that 4k (90Hz)  screen on. Lord knows how much it will last if it is turned down to 60hz FHD.Software is on par with iOS as far as usability and touch/feel is concerned. There is no news in  saying that  it is the fastest phone around.After the price cut it is the most affordable premium phone in the market today. Close your eyes, and go for it - you will not go wrong."
378,"Fingerprint scanner is slower than previously used capacitive sensor. Picture quality is underachieved by oneplus. Battery drains fast even in this brand new phone. Elegance is super hot. Screen is a flagship and performs well up to the point. Changing takes more time then it was claimed , ufs3. 0 storage increases a bit of speed of data transactions. Nebula blue colour is innovative. Heptic vibration engine will feel just like an apple phone ."
379,It is an average phone with a good display. Sound is good. Phone is very slippery and camera quality is poor with lacking clarity. Battery back up is average and worse than oneplus 6t. Buy op6t or op7. Do not buy op 7 pro.
380,"Presenting the best phone is the budget presented the 90hz is a visual delight, no doubt the in screen fingerprint reader is a bit slower than the conventional methods, camera add an extra dimension to the photography it's not just good it's really good. Nightsight could be a bit better but still it has come leaps and bounds since the 'dark ages' the battery life leaves more to be desired for but warp charge is the best thing to be adapted with in half an hour i can go from nay to gaming without thinking will the charge last or not.... It's just the best..."
381,"Full screen display feels always happy on investment.Very much like Night mode photos clicking and photos quality is very good.Charger: no comments always take less time and extend long life of batteryFlipped camera works very smootherHave wireless casting facilityDevice Support all south Indian language (Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam,Marathi) and Hindi, Gujarati English (Indian) and others.One Suggestion:1) If you provide the branded earphone with device.2) User manual available only in English and other international language. Kindly add Hindi language as mandatory as well as  if you added other Indian regional language that's would be for better."
382,"It is worth it. Camera was not upto the mark before update, but it has improved a lot recently. And future updates will definitely make it a great shooter.Other than that you'll love 90hz display, Fast, clean and uncluttered UI, and overall premium feel.Only issue is it is hard to find good cheap tempered glass atm and there is no official tempered glass from oneplus available yet.Overall, it is worth the money."
383,"I am using this phone from 1 months must say this is the best smooth and fast phone i have ever used till datei think every one knows about its specs and looks so i dont need to tell about that allI just tell you about its brief battery lifeSo if you are going to use this phone for calls whatsapp and media consumption you will get 5 or 5 n half hrs of screen on time or you can increase a bit by lower the screen refresh rate and resolutionBut If you play PUBG in this mobile then it will give you max 4:30 mins SOT and if you use its fanatic mode then you will get 4 hrs of SOT if you lower its resolution and screen referesh rate then it increase a bit by 15 min or half an hours of timeYou will get Warp charger in the box which is 30w charger so you can full charge your device 1:30 hrsOve all its a gud purchase and after purchase i got 3 to 4 OTA updates and oneplus rectify its bugs and camera issues and lots of minor improvementsAlao if you are planning to buy this phone then buy one armoured case for the phone security aa phone is very slim and you can not handle without caseif budget is not your concern you can definitely go for it or else you can look for op 7ConsThe cons i have noticed is its weight,no ip rating and average battery life rest all looks perfect to me"
384,Without  a doubt the best smartphone experience you can get for the price. A true masterpiece.  One thing to note is anyone who is planning to buy one be prepared to use a large phone.
385,Great product ... ultra smooth .. great build quality ... best smartphone in premium segment :)
386,Pros:1. Camera quality is superb2. Look is pretty stylish and decent with curve edges3. Processor is really fast and can be used for heavy gaming experience with 4k quality screen4. Smooth interface experience5. Fingerprint pretty fastCons:Battery drains really quickFingerprint doesn't work sometimes
387,"The screen is just amazing.Noholes,notches or gimmicks just the way I like it. Nebula blue is my new favorite color.The camera is the best compared to previous OnePlus products.The battery life is short but saved by the Warp Charge.All in all , an great smartphone."
388,"Loved this phone. The features included translate into a real world excellent experience. The 8GB RAM is more than enough. Using GCam with this improves photo quality, but one plus is also putting software updates. A solid phone that's worth the money we're investing in it."
389,"Just buy it if your budget allows. Everything is premium in this phone. Display, Camera, performance everything is great. I saw few reviews, people comparing camera with low end phones. The difference is the new AI feature with mid range phone which is just a software upgrade. AI camera images looks great but are automatically editing when clicked. This is the reason people feel some mid ranged phone phones camera are good but actually that's not. That's just a software they use.Taking that into consideration each and every thing is worth."
390,Great product.Snappy and superfast as u will expect from a Oneplus phone.Packed with the powerful Snapdragon 855 processor.Camera also excellent especially after update.Battery life surprisingly good and that Warp Charge is ultra fast.Display is best that any smartphone can get with 1440p Oled display and refresh rate of 90 Hz which sets it apart from competition.Gaming is the best experience with this display and powerful processor. Can play PUBG on HDR and Extreme graphics without any sort of lag. Too smooth.In display fingerprint scanner is the fastest I've ever seen.10 layer cooling tech works like wonders. Its nearly impossible to get this phone too hot. Even after long periods of gaming it stays cool.
391,"Overall experience of this phone is amazing, that display and the speed of this phone with that processor, refresh rate and Oxygen-OS work so well together, this phone is butter. Well worth the price tag, yes its expensive but it is not overpriced. Also got one year manufacturers warranty and 6 months of screen replacement protection plan. Lack of headphone jack and even the dongle is unfortunate, but I can look past it since I really love this device."
392,My sister bought this phone. As expected this is an amazing phone and has every feature one could expect. Battery life is almost a day (sometimes even more). Camera clarity is amazing. One thing I didn't like about this series is that OnePlus hasn't released tempered glass for it yet and every other tempered glass is just not good enough. After 6 months or so the camera clarity is very poor.
393,Don't waste your money buying this... One plus 7 is better than 7 pro
394,"DISAPPOINTED !!!This purchase was a surprise disappointment ! This is my 3rd 1plus buy... Have always loved their phones .This time around , I have recieved my OnePlus 7pro phone with a sort of notch on the side of the phone ,below the on- off button . Initially looked like a part of the bezel , but then I realised that the pixels were not working in the area . The black bezel like spot also has a voilet hallo around it . Haven't used the phone much to comment on the battery life, camera quality is decent . Fingerprint reader is not the best...OnePlus team and Amazon team have been cooperative so far..Have already enlisted for a replacement."
395,"Awesome phone, everything is flagship level. Fastest phone on the planet you can buy now."
396,It west of money
397,"This is a damn amazing phone. The video is as smooth as butter and you can somehow tell the difference between when it's running at 60Hz refresh rate and 90 Hz refresh rate. The 90 Hz refresh rate just feels much much cleaner and more absorbing. It is actually hypnotizing that's how good this phone is. You can use it for gaming and the visuals will be mind altering altogether. I was just playing Modern Combat 5 and wow what a mind bending experience it is. You can actually place yourself in the thick of battle with the chaos all around you. I have also played other games like temple runner etc. and they run like butter. Overall, very very very happy with this amazing phone and highly recommend it to anyone for any purpose whatsoever."
398,It is not a good product as we expected it is not Reaching the expectations it is one of the worst phone in its battery and by paying a large amount the finger print doesn't work properly and there was no response for our issue till 15 days still now no response was thereThe display will get lagged like hell
399,You cannot  distinguish between a screen off and black wall paper . Both seem same . Color detailing is even better than best.
400,"This product is a beast....with all the features and the 6.7"" screen with the 90hz makes it a perfect match for movies and video.....with the latest snapdragon 855 the phn is lighting fast......But not having a earphone or at least a type C to 3.5mm converter in the package was a bit of disappointment.Though the phn is not officially certified waterproof but from my previous one plus experience I could tell u it's not much of an issue....the device is water resistant to a good extentLastly the camera .....the portrait mode is legit....it has an amazing field of view.....the primary lenses also does a pretty decent job.....but the ultrawide lens is not up to the mark.....the dynamic range is not good and the photo also looks a bit noisy.....so some research is required on that part...The front facing selfie camera also does a good job....my best SELFIE CAMERA by farOverall if u ask me it's a pretty decent device to go with your daily activities and gaming; editing and other stuff like thatU won't regret buying this..üòÑüòÑ"
401,Finger print is very goodCamera good qualityBattery backup good
402,"It has an amazing display and it's buttery smooth with the 90hz refresh rate! The camera is a beast tho. Battery is decent. 6hrs sot once fully charged. And while gaming I get around 3-3.5hrs sot in fanatic mode while playing pubg! But people who are looking for more performance and better battery backup and smoothness, I would recommend them to go with Asus Rog Phone 2. By the way this review is from a long time OnePlus user and also Rog user! Peace. Have a good day! :)"
403,This is hands down the fastest phone out right now and will be for the rest of 2019 and 2020 until Oneplus 8 comes out. Oneplus tinkers with Android OS to prioritise on speed. This phone would easily last someone 3+ years. The screen is absolutely stunning and the 90hz motion on the screen makes it one of the best screens out. Camera is also brilliant and takes amazing pictures. It's got wide angle lens which I absolutely love. Similar to go pro. It's also got standard lens which takes great photos on day and at night too. And a zoom lens. Battery life is also very good and would easily last a day. I never have to worry about storage since it has enough to store for over 2 years for me. Google photos backs up unlimited photos and videos for free so I don't have to always keep photos in my device. So 256gb storage is an overkill and I love it. The price of this phone is a few hundred pound cheaper than others and is better to me! You would absolutely love the warp charger. It will charge your phone to around 50% in 20 minutes. It is a lot faster than Samsungs fast charge. The best part is that it will still charge fast even if you're using the phone where as other chargers will slow it down a lot. I have zero regrets from getting this phone! Thank you Oneplus for making an amazing phone.
404,"I don‚Äôt how they are charging so premium without quality,1+6t camera was so good so I thought of going for 1+7 pro but it‚Äôs not at all worth it I was using VIVO V15pro camera was much better simply I ve sold it for this worst phone"
405,"Pros:Kickass DisplayRegular Updates/patchesCons:Average camera. What's the point of having a triple camera if apart from the main cam, the other two are below par.Battery life is very average given the size and price. Getting a screen on time of 4-6 hrs.Too heavy and bulky.My indian sim card had no signal in Europe for the whole trip while my wife's OnePlus 5 with indian sim was able to latch on to networks in europe. Both of us use Jio.In display Finger scanner is a pain in the assFor the price I expected a better phone."
406,"I am using one plus 7 pro since the day it was launched in India. I am using the Mirror Grey version.I was waiting to complete at least 2 months before I post a review here.It is worth the money. So many people told me that the phone is looking great and asked me which brand it is.You will never go back to 60Hz refresh rate phones once you start using this 90Hz version.I admit that the phone is a bit heavier than the one which I was using before (Xperia Z5 premium), however, it doesn't matter.4 K videos are just awesome, the camera quality is very nice.The Dolby Atmos feature and the dual speaker combo is my favorite.All these are the Pros of PRO.Now, I have the habit of finding the wrong things when I find something too good :D-  No headphones jack, they don't provide the C-type headphones connector-  One plus wireless bullet earphones are always out of stock- Little heavier- Not that pocket-friendly"
407,It is a complete package the only flaw is the 3.5mm jack but u should also consider the power this product packs so not getting a jack is understandable. Awesome camera quality and good battery life lasts me the whole day on only one charge the 90Hz display is the best thing in this device. I just love it.
408,The One Plus 7 Pro exceeds expectations. Excellent seamless transitioning between apps and very good camera. Definitely worth it !
409,1st of all package arrived as per the committed date. Package was well packed and phone looks very premium with nebula blue colour. And the given tpu case was very nice and protective too. All box contents are ok but if the type c to 3.5mm connector is they given means it would be nice. Bcas we have to purchase it by additional cost..Pros:Display quality qhd display90hrtz refresh rate was niceFinger print reader was better sometime lagsWarp charger do's it's work betterNetwork connectivity and voice clarity also niceAndroid 10 after update battery is quite goodConsNo type c to 3.1 connectorAnd I can't get normal temper glass for this model bcas it needed uv tempered glass it cost you min 700/-Camera software could be updatedBulky in hand bcas of 208gm weightAnd need to be aware while holding phone in single handSo far better premium looking phone for this priceWorth to buying it
410,"The phone definitely looks great due to its big screen, 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. But it sincerely lags in Camera department even after updates. Video Recording, Voice Recording are great but i am not sure for some reason pics from its front camera just looks average and lacks true colors. Infact, my previous phone Redmi Note5 Pro used to click better selfies. Battery drains quickly if you use 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. Luckily, it has a warp charging adapter with it. Although, the phones gives you premium feel at a premium price but One Plus should look into the Camera Software updates. It's no where near to that of Pixel, Note series or Huwaei premium phones in terms of camera. Except for camera, this phone is a rockstar."
411,"It's extraordinary, only thing which is lagging when compared to Apple and pixel phones is camera. Nonetheless camera are also really good. Not to mention batter life is also good but not spectacular. Major pros of this phone are Display, performance, software, build quality and charging speed which is on another level. Over all very satisfying experience with this product. Well done OnePlus ! And I still miss the headphones jack !"
412,Oneplus 7 pro is best smartphone everAnd performance is every speed andSmoothness is awesome really superbbbbbb in 90 refresh ratePlus QHD+ display is really excellentBattery life is just gud but not excellentAnd camera is simply superbb and pictures will get clarity and front camera pop-up is very fast and  finger print sensor is really excellent and face unlock also simply superrr last but not least waterfall display or side screen display is lovely.overall 5 outof 4.7 is my rating
413,"I have been using this phone for more than a month now and here is my short review-Camera- Camera is extremely good until you bring s10 or iphone11 into competition....other than that it easily beats other phones falling below 50k lineSoftware and Speed- NO MATCH.....This is THE most fluid and comfortable experience i had using a phone ever....i dont think any phone can match this level of smoothnessBattery- Sort of Average i would say but Warp Charging is Extremely Fast and hence it makes the overall experience goodDisplay- NO MATCH....No Bezels, No Notch, No Punch-hole....Just Pure Screen....That Curved 2k 90hz display is the best screen i have ever used and even better than my friend's Note 10 PlusAudio- Dual Stereo Speakers Is Super loud and Crisp and gives a very enhanced music experienceBut i regret buying the oneplus bullets 2 as it sounds like budget bluetooth earphonesI also have attached some pictures...i would recommened to buy Nebula Blue as it looks different from the crowdThanks for reading"
414,Review after eight days of heavy use:Blazing fast.Fabulous screen.No heating.Transfer 25 GB of data from leptop in just 15 minutes .ConsBit heavy and uncomfortable for one hand use.Except it definitely buy it
415,"Review after 6months:Not preferable,1. when try to put face unlock that will the most weird thing you'll see, coz the cam should pop out and detect you and which will take time to complete this process.2. Major drawback is NFC(tap & pay) is disabled/not working, why would you put more money when this are not working?3. Lots and lots of bugs like when you swipe for menu most of the times you will observe the apps invisible.4. Phone gets heated alot and lot when you play pubg/games.5. As per the company this phone should hardly get warmer when you use for a long time, but the AMOLED this is pure nonsense.6. You'd feel it very slippery without having a cover.7. Battery backup is not that great, it will make you to charge twice in a day.8. Accessories are touching sky with their price."
416,"Writing this review after 1.5 monthSo guys the 90hz screen the best part you will definitely call in love with it from the day one it's buttery smooth with sd 855 man it's a beast playing HD games feels great on this phone.Charging is also fast ever morning I plug my device and I get my device all juiced up before leaving office in about an hour.Although it has no 3.5 mm headphone jack but you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy the c type bullets available at OnePlus website (they are awesome) or but the connector available at OnePlus website, so stop making a fuss about 3.5 mm jack (u are spending around 50k here, go buy a decent headphone too).Camera after the updates improved a lot and now pictures are quite good, still there are some issues with lowlight photos but in proper light the photos are good. Front camera selfie is also good no issues with that.Overall a nice phone, a bit overpriced (after looking at the price of k20 pro üòõ) but yes it's still the flagship killer and way better than many of it's competitors."
417,"It was a good phone...Display is great. The responsiveness of finger print scanner is disappointing....the primary camera was super. Selfie camera could have been better....One more thing to note is that, it's a huge phone...you may want to try it before buying it !I found some heating issue with the phone during the calls..."
418,"Super terrific phone. The display is out of the world. Buttery smooth touch due to the 90hz display refresh rate. Oxygen OS is simply the best and does not have any glitches. Recently got the Android 10 update also which is having much more features.Ther is no lag experienced while playing games requiring high performance and graphics. Fanatic mode is an added advantage for this.Coming to the battery department, I am able to use my phone for one and half days in a single charge. Icing on the cake is the 30W warp charger which charges from 0 to 70% battery in just 30 mins.Only con is in the camera department and that too it's not very bad, but not up to the expectation from a flagship phone. Particularly the selfie camera.Overall very much happy and impressed with this phone. Thank you OnePlus üôÇ"
419,Tremendous Excellent mobile phone by One +All the features is amazing üòçüòçüòçüòçCamera Quality is amazing especially Pop up camera looks üòé cool.
420,"I am using this device from last 2 months and it's seems good time to right my personal opinion about this device.Display is osm no doubt about it, and phone feel very premium in hand, but it's very slippery so impossible to use without Case.Battery charging speed is osm but battery backup is not that impressive. I am a normal user just check my email and business messages and youtube nothing else.I bought this device around 44k and now price drop to 39999 in 2 months.THE BIGGEST ISSUE WHICH I AM FACING WITH THIS DEVIVE IS THAT IT SUDNELY STOP WORKING AND THEN WORK FINE AFTER 2 OR 3 MINUTE LATER. I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ISSUE WHY SO MANY OTHER USER ARE GETTING THIS AS WELL.Hope this review will be helpfull for other buys are well."
421,"The performance of this phone is simply phenomenal. I opted for the 256 GB + 8 GB RAM option. With an uncommon screen refresh rate of 90 Hz ,scrolling through applications and switching between them is fast and buttery smooth. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and rarely misses on the first try. The edge to edge screen is huge and very emersive; being a class leading Samsung AMOLED screen colors are rich and vibrant. Using the pop-up selfie camera is both clever and fast. The camera quickly emerges from it's cubby hole and quickly returns. The phone can instantly detect when it's in free fall and will quickly and automatically retract the camera to avoid damage. A lot of reviewers lamented this phone's lack of official water resistance rating. The phone is definitely water proof. I have had it exposed to pouring rain and placed it on wet surfaces without any issues."
422,"Received the product in a day, thanks to amazon, the phone is working super smoothly, great gaming experience, it'll be too early to decide about the battery life, camera quality is good but i feel pictures are slightly artificial kind anyway it's still a flagship killer, processor is super fast.. Nebula blue is an eye candy"
423,"12 GB ram, the hell !! It's a lot of speed. Amazing display, with 90 Hz refresh rate, that's what a beast is.Love This phone, it's performance is TOP NOTCH. But still needs some camera Improvements specifically  in low light conditions. In camera section it is still under my SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 9.Go for it guys if you are too a hardcore gamer like me."
424,"This is my wife‚Äôs second oneplus and she is switching to this from an Oneplus 6. I would say this is the best flagship you would get at this price point.There are no second thoughts about it.The 90HZ display is probably the best in any smartphone right now.The camera is much improved than the older versions , battery life is good and the performance is top notch as usual.It still has a few cons though with not having wireless charging , a slightly sub par camera compared to the other higher end flagships and the lack of a pure ip rating.But at this price point you simply can‚Äôt complain.I would say if you are looking for the best bang for your buck smartphone this is the one you should go with without a doubt.."
425,"The fingerprint scanner is very fast and get's improved as you keep using. Battery life is good and fast charging makes your life easier. Camera is fabulous the rear one, selfie is fine in day light but the night mode is not that good. But gcam should do the work for this. If you don't use camera much and need top notch performance with a premium full screen curved edge go for this undoubtedly."
426,"Before i was using oneplus 6 that was also a great phone but after this I'm in love with it's curved display.. Now my old oneplus 6 looks me dull as compared to this beauty.. Apart form display the camera quality also good. extra Wide angle sensor gives more area to captured, indisplay fp is very accurate & fast, powerful sd855 processor gives awesome performance, New 30 watt warp charger(faster than dash charger) took around 1hr to get device full charge(4030mhz) and last easily full day(6-7hrs sot)."
427,"Switching from OP3 to OP7 Pro. Handsdown Best display for the price, fantastic interface, moderate fingerprint reader and camera which i guess will improve with software upgrades( i am comparing the camera with pixel and s10+). Sound quality is awesome both on speaker and headphones as well. Built quality is awesome, no hassle with popup camera. Got 8gb+256gb variant. Battery is also good and wrap charger is saviour. Best phone at 52k.. cheers OnePlus. Never ever settle for less.Ram management is superb. HDR10+ is just fantastic for viewing contents on mobile( Amazon Prime, netflix etc).Delivery was as always awesome. Thank u Amazon for that. Keep up the good work."
428,"pros:93% screen to body ratio :ofluid amoled 90hz displayoxygen osbeast in gamingwarp charging(55+ mins for full charge 0 to 100) and (30 mins for 0 to 70).cons:battery life ( if u use in qhd+ and 90hz, 4 hours 30 mins screen on time) or ( if u use fhd+ and 60hz, 7 hours screen on time). but then , this warp charging makes it a NEGLIGIBLE issue.fingerprint scanner is not so fast and accurate.......(well cant expect much from a optical fingerprint scanner.slightly heavier than a normal smartphone (well its huge.....)"
429,"One of the best looking smartphones out there. The display looks amazing, it is super smooth. The fingerprint scanner is also fast and better compared to 6T and other phones having indisplay fingerprint scanner. The camera have been improved a lot from past models(I used to have OnePlus 5T and also used OnePlus 6T for sometime). The battery backup is fine if you are using 60hz and 1080p resolution it would easily last a whole day even after gaming for 1.5-2hrs and with heavy usage of other apps. Speakers are also good they are quite loud enough. Charging speed is also good ..it charges from 0-100% in approx 1hr 16min average.Overall really good device. The constant updates makes it even better. Smooth and bloatware free OS."
430,"It was slightly better than all basic Chinese phones..like Mi note6/7 pro.. but a big miss in VOLTE CALLING /VOWIFI feature is not available even in oneplus 7pro models.. big disaapoinment at huge cost. Don't buy unless you don't want to use VOLTE or VOWIFI features..as this phone overpriced with lack of VOLTE calling features..in India..Also basic headphone jack converter should be given along with the inbox items after all we are.paying huge money.. company is not interested to give us the headphones .or wireless headphones even..I have a feeling of wasting 52,999 rupees in it."
431,"Nothing's beats the price point OnePlus is giving. Build quality is awesome. As far as the camera concern, you better get Gcam mod. Talking about the battery life you can get two days battery if you are using your phone for recieving calls and a bit surfing. I spent whole day in tracking and shot 400 beautiful pictures of mountains covered in clouds and a few stunning slow mo videos. Even after a whole day of photography and sharing my pictures, I left with 40% of battery in my phone and that's fantastic. Just love this phone."
432,I have been thinking lot about choosing this one or 7t but I needed display of OnePlus 7 pro so went with it and never had a thought of getting op 7t pro as it is way pricey and not much difference between this one and so1. Display is fantastic one of the best display I have seen ever2. Camera is not that great but it gets job done3. Battery is also on lower side as it's 90hz display consumes lot but as its charges quickly there won't be problem4. As per my usage I would say oxygen os is better than stock in many ways as it have lot and lot of customization5. It's a very minor thing - Haptic motor OMG it's just amazing you'll feel when you use it ..it's really super cool to experience while typing or navigating through gestures or receiving phone calls
433,"Pros1.Brilliant display90Hz is just beautiful2. Super fast charging even when using the phone3. Snappy fingerprint scannerCons:1. Average battery life ~ 6-7 hrs screen on time2. Camera can be better, I've had some focus issues3. Bring back the 3.5mm Jack"
434,I have always been a OnePlus user and have brought 2 & 5. The 7 pro is giving me lot of trouble with performance issue. The touch screen gets frozen at times. Delayed response. I am definitely letdown with 7pro. I paid extra for just the color . Don't know how to get support on my phone issue. Heartbroken fan of OnePlus
435,I was confuse between samsung s10 and one plus 7 pro...finally i bought one plus 7 pro its amazingly fast and value for money. Indisplay fingerprint is awesome its unlock within a sec. Nightscape mode is superb. Battery last a day even after heavy usage and gaming but it has no 3.5 jack and they dont even provide headphone after charging more than 50k that the only negetive thing
436,"Don't even buy to think waste of money phone is not even 1% splash proof, if you will have any issues with water damage than they won't consider your phone in warranty and they will let you know that your phone is not even a splash proof. Buy it if you have enough money to spend."
437,"We, in family using oneplus from Gen 1 to Pro ...1, 3, 6T, 7Pro etc. ....this is true market leader and delivers like pro. iphone of Android, that's it! At a great price point."
438,"Overall a good mobile though the camera is not upto the mark as when we zoom into an image after clicking all of it gets mixed with the objects in the background. Though the nightscape mode and portrait mode of this phone is just great but normal camera does just a decent job. I was a big fan of OnePlus and was using OnePlus 3 before purchasing this and other than a little hardware update there is nothing much to this device. Also, its not worth the money (58k) just because of no IP rating and poor camera performance.After using for about 3 months I can rate:-Battery performance:- 4.5/5Camera:- 3/5Software:- 5/5Display:- 5/5Value for money:- 3.8/5."
439,"The worst experience I ever had  since I started using mobile. With lot of expectation ordered One Plus 7 Pro,and surprisingly  received a handset  with technical issue. Mobile system was going on updating even after 3 hrs , failed.to update. Have reported the issue to customer care and they  replaced  after 2 days . Even the second mobile has the same problem. I am forced to return the same. What more I can say about my experience ..The worst ever"
440,"Amazing screen that can rival other flagships from Apple/Samsung, but the camera could have been better. At 57,999 they could've done much better with camera quality, by far this is the only let down, hopefully a software update can fix things to an extent."
441,Awesome phon from one plus ...it's great n smooth experience......I'm the  loyal customer of one plus...And connect with this company from last 4 years...Oxicision os is top class os in Android smart phone.I used one plus 7 pro from last 25 days..it's give smooth n wonderfull experience........but it's have only problem that battery life ....but it's k....it's not matter for this type of big screen n 90hz reefresh rate phone.....its...so smooth n flagship killer phone....I  already have  one plus 5 .....from last 2 years it's great..n now upgreat to one plus 7 pro....great quality from one plus....great service from amazone.....thanks a lot
442,"Pure performance flagship killer, but not yet flagship.Excellent build quality, super screen, awesome battery backup, pure performance no lag in apps.Super fast charger best in classButAverage camera quality ( my previous were Samsung note 8 and iPhone 6 ) it not compared to anything near to my previous Samsung note 8 in image quality. I can say Samsung s10+ and s10 are real beast in camera don't forget Huawei p30 pro.Fingerprint sensor is super fast but sometimes some apps Don't show up sensor to unlock.If you are looking for camera centric smartphone go for iPhone XR or Samsung s10 series.Oneplus 7pro is best in performance"
443,"Once I started using one plus, I have been hooked, good value for money , this is my second exchange through Amazon portal, product meets the expectations in terms of build quality, ease of using, friendly interface,  quick charging, sufficient battery life, commendable sound and image quality."
444,"Whenever you put call on speaker mode and talk, the receiver is doesn't listen to our voice, the voice breaks and this is a blunder technical issue, which even one plus are not able to resolve from my phone."
445,"Call quality is actually poor, I got many ppl saying that when they call, they are able to hear their own voice or the voice is breaking... Before buying this phone, it wasn't the case"
446,"Awesome and worth it device. If you did call something perfect, this is it. Awesome in every aspect being camera, screen, speed, gaming, ram management, updates, improvements and everything. If you look for devices above 35k , i suggest wait, collect a bit and go for this one. Will be your perfect daily life hack companion.Loving it man!"
447,"The most beautiful phone i have ever seen.The thing which makes it more attractive is its screen (QHD display with 90Hz refresh rate!!!!) The best display i have seen on a smartphone. And the other two things which i loved about this phone is the haptic motor and the Warp charge.Overall this phone ia worth every penny you spend.My friend bought Samsung Galaxy S10 plus and we tested out which fone is better, and there was doubt that OnePlus 7 pro is the clear winner.Thank you OnePlus for such an amazing product.Proud to be a part of OnePlus family."
448,"A must buy , I was initially not able to make up mind for this beauty but trust me the phone is a masterpiece.Mine model is 6/128 MG , No lags , no bloatware, no ads (mi,realms,vivo,oppo),immersive display view on full screen.The gaming is super smooth and fluid ,no matter what game you play.Camera zoom and picture quality is awesome.Viewing movies on QHD gives so immersive view on the full screen.Go for it , a bang for buck phone."
449,"Fingerprint reader is not that great. Sometimes if doesn't recognise. Far unlock is great, which is why I'm still okay to continue using this.Camera quality is more than amazing during day. Taking 4k videos with 60fps is a treat to eyes. But evening photography is very bad. Every photo i take captures a lot of noise.Battery life is amazing. I get a battery life from 100% to 0 for2 days."
450,"No doubt at present it's the best phone available in the world. At first I thought it's a bit costly but after using it for a month take my word it's worth every penny.I will not mention the features as we all know it, but it's really super fast, the touch is excellent, display has no match and it is super smooth, battery can easily last for full day even with heavy use and the wrap charger fulls it very quickly. Finger print reader has no match, it has great camera with some great features, very good quality even in low light. Friends Oneplus 7pro really is a great Masterpiece by Oneplus.Those making mind to buy but are a little doubtful........ take my word, buy it with closed eyes, you will Love it. Thanks Amazon for 2 day delivery."
451,"The Good The OnePlus 7 shares the Pro's powerful processor, has a great battery life and comes with a more affordable price tag. The Bad Its lack of a pop-up selfie camera and additional wide-angle lens means it's more of a marginal upgrade over last year's OnePlus 6T than a variant of the OnePlus 7 Pro"
452,Brilliant phone under affordable price only disadvantage is that its tough to find a perfect tempered glass
453,It has manufacturing defect at time of vibration it make sounds and speaker is not working properlyOne plus I am excepting from u like thisU have broken my trust in your product
454,"My ratings on various parameters...out of 5Design - 5Camera - 4.5Gaming - 5Battery - 4.5Size - 5Touch - 5Overall excellent product and I would refer everyone for it's built up, look n feel and performance. Worth it . Well done one plus üëç"
455,So far the experience has been very good. I will keep my review of the phone short and simple.Looks: 5/5 (Mesmerizing)Build: 4.5/5 (Solid)Camera: 3.5/5 (Could have been better)Display: 4.5/5 (Awesome)Battery: 4/5 (charging is super fast)Sound: 3.5/5 (Decent)Performance: 5/5 (Excellent)
456,I am not happy because oneplus 7 Pro is not good for me because this one very bad experience in my sideBefore I am using all oneplus mobile it will also super for me camera quality and battery life fingerprint also super but oneplus 7pro not goodI am sorry I am not happy because waste my money and waste my time this is my last oneplus brand mobile purchasing I am not purchasing another time in my life
457,"This phone is best till date from OnePlus.Camera quality - 4/5Battery life - 3.5/5Display - 5/5Fingerprint reader - 5/5Performance - 5/5The 90 Hz display is just awesome but consumes more battery, and it's worth it. Camera could have been better but I'm overall satisfied with the camera because I believe it's not about the tools when it comes to photography.The infinite curved display with stereo speakers give the best viewing experience when it comes to watching movies / series on the phone.Simply, go for it."
458,"Adaptable usage, captivating screen presence, amiable towards eyes, diligent software, and a phenomenal experience using this phone. Heck, I'm even reading e-books( never read a book before btw) online, that's how fun the screen refresh rate is helping me with. Yes camera needs some work, but hey they did a good job.The only set back(in a way) is, I was dreading to get almond(8gb,256), and settled for grey(6 GB, 128).. because almond is not available in 6gb and when i checked my ram usage recently, i was only using 4.5gb of 6gb with 62 apps. 8gb would be an over kill, so not really a set back."
459,Worst product because at this price this is not water proof and they claim it as water resistant but that is not true as my phone screen got completely damaged in minor rain. Don‚Äôt buy this at this price.
460,2 months on and the experience has been great so far. Whether it's about taking pictures or watching that high-res video song is just a matter of pure indulgence. Totally in love with the 90 Hz Display that gives videos and live wallpapers an extra fluid factor. Camera quality is superb and the overall processor response is like overwhelmingly good. Initially there were some lags with opening of the camera those are not present now after the updates. Kudos to the OnePlus Team for giving a nice finish to the exterior look and overall aesthetics of the Phone. True Notch-less Experience that is worth owning.
461,Overall average product for the price i paid. The disaster is internet speed is superrrrrrrr slow in this.  i was using oneplus3 previously and switched to this model now and now I can't use internet at all. Beware before buying this product.
462,"its a great phone in this price segment.  best display, premiums looks and built quality, the fastest phone, smoother experience, best choice for heavy gamers and for the best graphics..the only con is average berry life.. if you are a heavy user..u will have to charge twice in 24 hours..but quick Dash charge is super fast.. so if twice charging in a single day is ok then go for it..face unlock is but slower as popup camera takes time to get opened. overall its the best flagship smart phone if your budget is around 40-50k.."
463,"Super awesome product in such a cheaper price. It's my first time using android phone and have to say that one plus delivers a very premium quality in such a low price. I would everytime recommend this product to those who are thinking to buy apple or samsung smartphone, just give this phone a try it will never disappoint you. The fingerprint scanner, camera, gaming experience, movie watching experience are some of the things has always been at the top notch for me."
464,"Reviewing after one week of usage, seems like really behind the speed, you love this phone with the performance, battery life and 90HZ refresh rate. Moreover display is killing while watching movies it shows its's capability. Coming to the oxygen OS no words this is the best one in the today's market. As of my personal advise if you want to buy 8 and 8 pro just ignore that and go with 7 pro, because they provide almost same features. Expect 865 processor and reverse charging. For gaming and general usage 7 Pro is best."
465,"I had an option of getting the S10+ or the OP 7 Pro. Glad I went for the latter. Firstly, I do not spend big bucks on a phone for camera. I base my purchases on a phone for the performance and the speed.  Even though the camera is not as good as S10+  the OP 7 Pro makes up for it by having notchless display and 90 Hz. When people say there's hardly any difference  between 60 Hz and 90 Hz it is not true.  I also went for 12 Gb option so this helps battery draining apps to run in the background. Only issue is the battery does not meet my expectations and the whole charge barely lasts 18 hours."
466,Everything is superb ....minor changes needed....battery life could be better but good as compared to the display size and quality.....the dispaly and camera are the best one....Get a major issue with the device.....its get swtich off as i connect it to charging......one month review.....i really hate one plus now.....first one plus device may be the last one tooo.....
467,Product is as per description. Screen guard had bubble. Camera quality is good.Battery when charged 100% will run full day. Speed is good.
468,Best smartphone in the market.
469,"Firstly, a great phone, all the features which it has right from the notchless display to the 90Hz refresh rate coupled with the space and the UFS 3.0 transmission, this device works buttery smoothWith the android 10 update now availale, the phone has only improved system and UI experience wise with dark mode and the addition of digital well-being.Though a bit overpriced than Redmi K20 pro, i feel if you really want a great UI experience with the Oxygen OS and dont mind spending a little more for a phone, this phone will serve you atleast 3-4 years making it value for money"
470,I was sceptical before ordering almond colour but it looks amazing in person. Pictures on Amazon do zero justice to actual look of the phone. I am so glad I got this one. Needless to talk about features because it is OnePlus after all.
471,"Speed and 90 Hz UHD Display is all about this phone. One you use 90 Hz buttery smooth display, it is almost impossible to go backward in 60 Hz. Camara Quality is as usual pretty normal in all one plus phone. It will not justify the price tag. Portrait mode is worst. Only good thing in Camara is Night Mode. Performance and Display are outstanding. Haptic feedback and Dual Sterio Speaker also good.UFS 3.0 Fast storage is also USP for this phone as no other phone have. Not for a Camara beast. Good who is looking for 90Hz smooth display and fast performance."
472,"Like:1. Superb screen. It's incredible. Maybe the best that I have seen on a mobile device.2. Great battery life and charging speeds for such a power house.Dislike:1. The camera is really really bad for the hype they created.2. Can't stress enough, camera is sub-par. Especially when you take pictures from third party apps in low light."
473,The phone is Just Awesome.1.The quality of display and audio is nice.Curve display is very good looking.2.phone is very smooth to operate.3.Gaming performance graphics is very good.4.There is no heating issue. But instantly cools down when gets warm.(warm means not high you think just little bit when you play games.)5.pop up camera is no problem you can raise many times it not effect.Note:-Overall very good phone in these price range. Don't believe any negative Comments.
474,"An excellent product that delivers on its promise. Looks premium, has superb performance and a good camera. Only con I feel after two weeks of usage is the form factor.. While the display more than makes up for it, is it is not a phone you can comfortably operate with just one hand."
475,This this product is defective and I have file complain to return the my handset and today (11/6/20)my handset inspection but your technician not came today .That on 14/6/20/ your technician inspection my handset and told him verbally  handset is defective.But your company not to return/Replacement till to date
476,"While starting for the first time newly bought one plus 7 pro, it was asking to wipe up the data and rest factory settings then Reboot. however if it is new phone there shall not be any data present and it should already be wiped up. Can you please suggest if this unusual and I should go for return the phone and ask for new one."
477,Nice phone but headphone feature must be in it. If the head phone rearranged by the oneplus team Than it is super. But camera quality is also much than the other phones it is blurred so many times if ur hand is little bit shaky or or little bit ur moving the quality get worst. Oneplus team need to improve this system also for the camera quality for the moving person or little bit moving or shaky hands. Otherwise it is excellent for gaming or battery life.
478,Sir display can't working properly some time one line on display so please replace my phone one plus 7 pro one 3day use my phone and find some problem so please help
479,"After a use of 25 days I find it a worst purchase of my life.@Screen guard has many scratches on it. And there are Air bubbles at 3 spots. That is provided by One+@Head phone dongal not provided, which was provided by One+ earlier. had to get new one so cost of mobile is ‚Çπ40000 + ‚Çπ1000. Most dispointed on this.All this is provide by other brands under ‚Çπ10000 to ‚Çπ15000.Hope my first and last -One i.e. One+ device and suggest other the same."
480,The overall performance of phone is just fantastic.Handy phone.I m using this phone since 3 months.Camera quality is awesome and the screen quality is also fabulous and the last is about battery life it last about 6-7 hours after heavy usage but 30 watt charger save our day it charge the phone 0-100% in about 90 minutes.So it's a must buy.
481,"It is a good phone except that now since One Plus 7T and 7T Pro are here. They are a better option. And the 7T is cheaper as well.Apart from that, you can also get 2000 more off if you used my referral. In case you need a referral, you can mail me at danschmidt4321@gmail.com or 9711382150 whatsappThe phone's 90Hz display is the main thing about it. But only for gaming would you see a stark difference and realise how good it is. If you don't intend on doing that, then no point buying a 90Hz display.Great audio quality. Camera is amazing! The nightscape mode is great as well."
482,"Some time Touch sensor doesn't response so advice me what to do after 11 day of purchase m facing problem .camera quality is not up to Mark standard ,don't know problem is my phone or it's a OnePlus quality standard.immidiate after purchase I request to give me seller contact details but not provided to me , Don't know why .RegardsPunit"

484,"I am using this phone from past one month and trust me guys, one of the best phone in the market right now. Battery life is far better than my previous samsung flagship phones. Camera is good but the main thing is display. Best display in market right now. Amazing sound quality. No comparison in terms of performance and charging is amazingly fast. Only drawback is regarding the notifications i.e. there is no AOD and notification LED so you have to wake up the phone each time to check whether you have received notification or not."
485,"Excellent phone ! LovedFan of OnePlus mobiles , quality is amazing , Glossy finish makes it look more beautifulBattery performance = 5 starDispay : 5 starSpeed : 4 starCamera : 4 starOs : 5 star"
486,Have being using it since last 2 days .. Didn't find any feature which is new or unique to 1+7 series. In fact there r lots of good features in my last mobile Honor 8X which I found missing in this.Big disappointment is1) Fast battery discharge. Full charge lasted for 21 hrs only.2) Dual sim reduced functionality.3) Android 9.04) Settings very complex
487,"Good and speedier product, suitable for business as well as personal use. MS Office works very fine. Curved screen gives extra large viewing. Easy to hold. Original karboon back cover adds to its business-look.Battery easily lasts three days at moderate use. Very helpful.Did not use camera or finger-print reader till now.Overall a prized possession who has been using BlackBerry for over 10 years and, after its discontinuance, was looking for equally good product."
488,"I am a huge fan of one plus mobiles , for the 1st time I have bought one plus 7pro , all features are excellent but only three problems are bothering me1st one : though I kept the fingerprint reader security for phone  it doesn't working properly and phone lock  is opening  up like a normal like named swipe up2nd one : sometimes fingerprint scanner tooks more time to unlock the phone3rd one : battery life is not greater , when compared to Samsung j7 series  it doesn't gives 60%of battery life of j7Please work on it and update me how to solve my problemsI never want to change my brand from one plus , and if the problem continues how can I be tied up with you"
489,Battery drain problem and hanging problem in this one plus 7 pro 12gb ram.very worst phone of one plus in one series and cost is too much high and it doesn't deserve this cost.
490,"This is one heck of a phone.What's Good:Awesome DisplayAwesome CameraAwesome warp ChargingI was a iphone user and recently decided to give OnePlus a Shot.It won't let you down, Got for it.One to One, I'll say its even better than Iphone. Plus you got so much user control when you use android, everything is so restricted in iphone.Loved this Phone."
491,One Plus Genuinely Could have worked on the camera picture quality . It's Just mediocre. The Phone is a beast when it comes to Gaming and it doesn't heat up. Battery life is Good considering it's a performance based fone. Overall not satisfied with the pricing but happy with the performance
492,"The best thing about this phone is the screen and battery life. Hands down the phone lasts for a full day with heavy screen on time and could last a day n half or even two with little usage. However, the camera is a big disappointment for me who is coming from Google pixel phone. Also, for the features and quality of this phone, I believe it could have been priced between 35-40k and not more."
493,Awesome handset so far. I have not faced any issue. The only thing I have to mention is the connectors missing from the box. C-Type to 3.5mm should have been given in box along with hands free. Anyways that is what I think may be most of them dont think that way.
494,"First of mesmerizing display with super amoled QHD+ with 90hz refresh rate,It's quality was simply awesome.Front Camera is Good and Back triple cam does their job pretty well .Charging with wrap charger was super fast.SD 855 and UFS 3.0 STORAGE  makes everything faster than faster.Overall phone is super..."
495,After using of 2 days I have found that camera and processor are ok. But my phone is getting heated very much. Even I haven't used it at gaming nor has watched any movie yet but it is heating very much. Fast Charging which I think should be increased at this price level. Phone took more than 1.5 hr to get full charged. Other phone cheaper than this has feature to get charge in less than 1 hour and also having them bigger battery than it. Battey backup is also not appreciatable. Either Amazon has gave me a defected piece. What should I do to return this ?
496,"Everything ok excellent feel , finger print sensor not at good as per this phone standard... doesn't work properly. Again and its show mismatch. Getting irritated. With this high cost, their is No head set , no c type connecter to 3.5 audio Jack. The packaging is very very worst.. no bubble wrap , outside box got damage. Really disappointed"
497,Best phone. Everything is good. There is no place to say bad. I love it. I use 17day running..
498,"Camera quality is not that good , fingerprint reader doesn't work properly"
499,"Product sturdy, neat, premium finishWorth the valueSpeed blinding fast won't feel the lagDisplay is next level with 90hz refresh rate colours are very vibrantVibration feedback powerfulSound loud enough for a roomProcessing power no lag no matter how many apps running in background"
500,"I would have given it 5 out of 5 stars, had they not removed the audio jack or at least they should have provided an alternative in the box. Huge let down!! As a person who uses phone to listen to music, podcasts and audio books, I must say I am regretting my decision."
501,"Great product by OnePlus.. device is something like you always want to use, display is very vibrant and crispy, 90Hz makes it more smoother, camera performance is also very good, finger print scanner is beyond expectations, very fast and accurate, battery life is decent, I am a heavy user, It last for 1 day on heavy use, Gaming experience is going to be unbelievable with this device. I play PUBG and asphalt 9 legends, all went very fine and smooth! Go for it guys if you need a all-round performance. A perfect device. Love you Oneplus"
502,"It is a very awesome phone. Stunning display and excellent stereo speakers. Its very fast, may be the fastest phone among all competitors due to 90 hz. Battery power is very good. Camera is also good. The only hitch is the headset jack, which is not found. Overall 5 stars and value for money."
503,"Yes a really good phone just a little expensive,I have got the 12gb ram one thought it will help in my gaming experience but you cannot use the full 12GB most of the time it's around 5.5 GB and and maximum cases it goes to six so you can also buy 8 GB model and save money to buy the accessories for your in short a really good food just a drawback that its camera quality not that up to the mark in fake kind wost"
504,"Can't go back to a phone with an 60 hz display after using this one for a couple of months it's an steal deal for 40K , display is awesome and camera's are fine not bad not too good but charging speed is so good that it can beat any phone , was confused between iphone 11 and op 7 but I am glad that I saved my 20k and also got an better phone"
505,"A great product. Still given a rating of 3 *. Why? I bought he product  and within 2 weeks a new product has come. Another 2 weeks later yet another product. Not sure if I have paid the right price. Since it was released in such a quick succession, OnePlus should have provided a price protection. Hence, I had given a rating of 3"
506,"Everything is good , except for the camera quality especially the portrait mode . One plus 5 gives better images than one plus 7 pro . Not worth paying 52k . Oppo k3 is equally good"
507,I'm writing this review after 5 months using the mobile i bought this 8-256 combination mobile phone through amazon the phone performance was awesome with 90hz speed and the sound is clear and loud camera was good and the battery life is not to expected levels battery drains soo fast
508,Loved the camera. High speed gaming. 90hz refresh rate makes video watching smooth. Overall great. But you need to charge the photo every day. But charging is super fast. If you have a budget of 50K then go for this phone.
509,"This is perhaps the best bet if you are looking for a good smart and a sexy Android phone. With the latest OS and other features, the phone stands out at par. I have been using the phone since 3 weeks now and I love it's screen and the video quality. It got great camera too."
510,"This is my first one plus device and I am quite impressed with the quality of the phone, however I faced an issue where the camera app kept crashing for which I rebotted the device and the issue got solved. I hope that is just a temporary glitch. The portrait mode works only in telephoto mode and is quite annoying for indoor photography. Hope we get a software update for this. battery charging is very fast and last for a day very comfortably."
511,No need to mention specs here. It's a classy phone and my search for a good phone ended here. Now only time I will buy a new phone will be when 5G us totally used in india. Till then it is this OP7 PRO. really good phone.
512,"Don't go by the media uplift of the product. It's not worth the money. Still need a lot of software updation, new issues are arising as one is getting solved. Camera is not so great as they say. But looks good & feels good too so if you don't care about small issues then go for it who am I to stop you?"
513,"12GB,256GB Variant.Ordered on 15th August 2019. Delivered on 18th August 2019 (Sunday) Fast delivery.Awesome smartphone.Loud Speakers truly amazing experience for music listeners.I am not facing any heat up issue in idle condition.I not tryed on game play.Some issues with Ambiant Light Notification.Some time appears some time not.Battery back up is not good before update.After update its slightly improved.But u don't have to complaint about this.Because this phone have a larger display with 90HzRefresh rate.so no complaints.Overall Smartphone is awesome."
514,"The mobile is overall very good,but needs improvement in camera,especially night mode camera...trust me its completely useless... you will not be able to click any pics in night mode,where there is no aur very dim light...and if u will ignore the camera than i guess it is the best set now you can purchase at this price,also almond colour is very pretty....touch is awesome,speed is fantastic,features are more than enough...loved the set"
515,Camera quality is really awesome but phone is not working as smoothly as it was in beginning and battery lyf disappoints me very much  from the very first use. Front fingers print senser is not so good as it is in back .I hve been using this phon for past 6 months .
516,"The phone is really fast. The animations are smooth. No lag whatsoever. I upgraded from note 9 and so far liking the experience. The screen is big and no notch. Colour caliberations is very good. My battery life is on par with note 9. I get around 4.5-5 hours of screen time with moderate usage and at the end of the day I end up with 35-40 percentage charge left. The only drawback I feel is lack of headphone jack. Also, no headphone provided in the package ‚òπÔ∏è."
517,"Fingerprint reader is good but in sometimes its not accepting , using temper and scratch cards has a poor performance in fingerprint, back camera is good as i expected but iam not satisfied with front camera this is not a phone for selfie. Battery life is very poor only 5 hours standby"
518,"Writing review after using it for 2 monthsPros:1) Amazing display.2) long battery life and fast charging3) Perfect device for gaming.4) Super feather touchCons:1) hangs sometimes, but not a big issue."
519,Heavy.... Uninspiring design.... Below par camera.... Display far from Samsung S 10.... Refresh rate is fluid. Otherwise a lot of hype.
520,"Gud one  ..I bought this phone last week..and all bad rumors are wrong about it...This is an amazing phone in everything ..specially in games it it so smooth , let it be PUBG or any other high graphic games ..and it's battery charging and Curved (looks like 3D) is awesomeüòò ...Also reviews about 1 or 2 star for this smartphone are all from fake bad marketers or morons . Its been almost 8 months since I am using this phone and me and everyone I know Loves it"
521,Switched from iphone to OnePlus. First time using a OnePlus device.Display is beautiful and attractive. . You can feel the 90 hz display on ur fingertips.Overall decent battery life. Lasts for a day. Drains rapidly while watching videos and playing games.Processor is superfast and super snappy. Oxygen os works very well.
522,PHONE SOO MUCH HEATED USED ONLY SOME TIME BUT ITS SO MUCH HEATEDAND BACK CAMERA IS NOT CLEAREDYOU CAN ALSO SEE THE CAMERA QUALITY IN PHOTO
523,"I have purchased One Plus 7 Pro (Nebula Blue) 12/256 from Amazon. Overall look of the handset is fine but it keeps getting hanged while talking and it's touch sensor is not up to the mark . Overall i am not happy with the handset i received,  i don''t know whether store has given an old/used handset to me because other friends of mine are using the same phone but they are not finding this issue as such and they bought it from Chroma."
524,One plus is a big brand now.over all features of phone is good.but I am really disappointed with one plus not even proving any kind of earphone or earphone jack as well..now a day if I am purchasing a nokia1280 worth rs 1000 also providing earphones & one plus 7 pro Is of 53k bro..highly disappointed
525,Battery performance is not that much good .If we use continuously the charge doesnot remain for 12 hours
526,"This was the immediate response:Fingerprint sensor could have been better. Battery life is awesome. Display is again a thumbs up. Earphones absence in the box had let me down. But over a good phone, may little over priced I felt.After 11 months usage:Definitely not worth the money. It's only a spec sheet phone. It hangs a lot. I have gone service center almost 5 times. And their services is again not customer centric. Phone still hangs often. It gets heated up like hell. Sometimes I can't hold it, it gets that hot while charging or sometimes when I play games. Really pathetic and strongly against getting this phone!"
527,It is an good product plus i got a best deal. The phone is premium fantastic blasting super duper good and thanks to ‚ÄúDarshita Electronics‚Äù for the good and wise product and service and deal. Thanks a lot will be looking forward for some more products. Fully satisfied üéÅüòä keep it up.
528,Battery-*****Display-*****Battery-*****Fingerprint-*****Camera quality-*****Such a great phone with great specifications...fallen love with this phone.. Really awesome
529,Fingerprint reader is not functioning properly even l have seen the threads related to fingerprint that is getting unlocked with the finger which is not registered. This is serious thing l hope one plus update the bugs as it will be loss to the actual owners who had bought this and battery is good but nothing incredible PL think these are the only things which are to be fixed by OnePlus and gaming l have tested yet heard lot about it and overall rating would 3.8
530,If you are android user and you want something fast in your life than go for it best device in terms of everything
531,Mobile are too good
532,"The phone is little heavier than previous OnePlus models, I understand 4000 battery and big screen. Otherwise it deliverd as promised. Initially it fails 2-3 time during initial setup due to software glitch but hard-reboot helped to restore the error. The mobile is a charm."
533,"This is the first One plus phone I'm using. It's great. Especially the touch experience, it is awesome. The screen response and smoothness is flawless. Not the right person to speak about processor or gaming experience.One thing I felt is camera can be little more advanced. We can not zoom or adjust in Nightscape or Portrait modes. Slowmotion recording in low light is not good as expected. Expect these two everything is more than expected.... Loved this"
534,"The only thing I resent about this phone is the exclusion of the headphone adapter/dongle in the box. Oh and the cheap quality tpu case that comes with it. Dick move OnePlus!Phone is great however, though for the asking price of 58K it better be."
535,This mobile phone is awesome in this series. After using for 1 month I realise that this phone is the best amongst other flagship mobile phones. Camera filters needs to be reviewed by OnePlus . No network issues at all. 90 hz display is wonderful. Overall excellent product
536,I absolutely liked the mobile. There is no ifs and buts. Looks are super. Feel is even more super. Charging speed is excellent. Usage is very easy. Finger scan is good. Highly recommended in the high end mobile category. Must buy.
537,"Overall the phone is awesome camera ,batter, lookwise, soundquality without earphones, popup camera tottaly best phone Only one thing i dnt like that oneplus should provide c to 3.5  converter for  earphones  must...have a 100% look on this... And if they  then plz send me 1 pair... Eles tge the phone is best"
538,"If you think you can live without headphone jack, think again. Get Bluetooth headphones and it's the best phone in the world.Battery / charging speedScreen (dimensions and resolution)PerformanceAudio (speaker)GamingEverything is top notch.Camera is also okay... You won't be able to tell the difference. Pop up camera works fine.The case provided by OnePlus sucks... So get that also."
539,"The basics tenants of smartphone design weren't radically challenged the previous year.But 2019 ,brought a few exceptional releases.And this is the phone I am talking about....Saying this an expensive is a contradiction.In today's days of industrialization and globalization, both life and time is synonymous. And running with this phone is much easier as compared to today's world.Not only it has best features but has an awesome look. Finally, this phone is incredible..."
540,"Have been iPhone user for ages, so initially found the It difficult. Phone looks premium and attractive. Configuration of the phone makes it value for money. Excellent picture quality. battery life is excellent and you don't have to charge your phone again and again , and for a long time"
541,I bought this Oneplus 7pro after using Oneplus 3T for almost 3 years. There is nothing I can complain about. At this price range Oneplus is providing very standard hardware. This makes the phone last longer than any other devices of this price range.
542,NO HEATING PROBLEM..BUTTERY SMOOTH..INSANELY FAST..SUPERFAST CHARGING..AWSOME CAMERA..THE BLUE BEAST..ü§üüòé
543,Battery is draining very badly one disadvantage I could see in OnePlus even though the charge is full within an hour it drains down completely. Giving two stars because of camera and fingerprint reader
544,Its a beast... Don't think much go for it.... Youtubers will always make confusion.. if you like it buy it... You won't regret... And it looks better thn what you see in youtube or pictures..... And its not thaaaat big that you will get tired of holding.... My hands are pretty small but im completely okay with it.... Gamers will love it more..... ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
545,"Is amazing smart phone .. what a sound üòç,what a display.. and camera to Masha Allah üòç.. and Check its fast charging duration te from full discharge bettry only in 75min.100 persend charge.. ‚ù§Ô∏è truly awesom.. and speed ka to jawab nhi .. if u used finger print onece  u will definitely forget the face unlock because its fingerprint sensor is very fast only in 0.20 second unlock the device. I just fall in love with it .. thanks allot Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è .."
546,This is simply the best smartphone u can buy right now.. with medium price point its got everything tht flagship offers.. some people says camera quality not gud but trust me im using this for a month now n camera is sooo gud tht it could easily compared with other brnds flgships which cost a fortune to buy.. battery life n charging speed will simply blow your mind.. donot trust those bad reviews by youtubers!! Jst go for it.. i will not regret it.. i can assure u tht!
547,Don't buy not worth for this cost. Even 12 gb ram it's getting hang and one plus was not provided tempered glass for this phone and it's difficult to find out side. Totally it's a not Good.
548,"Great cameraAwesome performanceone of the best Displayawsm & loud Dolby Atmos soundButtery smooth performance.but need to  software update in wide angle camera, finger print scanner.otherwise phone is just killing"
549,When you pay 50 k you don't expect the selfie camera to be so pathetic.no wireless charging .it's weighs like a brick in my pocket.the gps issue they had in previous model isint fixed.no USB type c to aux adaptor.if the price was 30k I would have complained so much but now it's totally ridiculous
550,"1. Awesome speed is great,2. No heating issue.3. Charged in 1 hrs.4. It's slippery without cover which makes it difficult to handle with one hand.5. Camera is good but it's not covering the natural mode it's making you more beauty.6. Gaming mode is great.7. Screen fingerprint reader is good not as fast as I thought of."
551,A good device. Review after 3 months. The best part is it's display. Finger print reader and face recognition are in the higher level. Camera is ok but not awesome. Battery is also up to the satisfactory level. Recommended to purchase it place of Apple devices in want to enjoy the Android platform. You can get more details in YouTube. 5 out of 5 stars.
552,"I don't know why I'm seeing so many negative reviews, personally, I haven't seen any issues so far from past 1 week of usage.The camera is not up to the mark but I hope future updates will solve this. Every product has its pros and cons.Hope one plus solves the issues related to the camera."
553,"The best smartphone you can buy under this price range.Insane DISPLAY, you can feel the 90hz display while u touch. Clean OS and the SPEEEED.PRIMARY CAMERA is awsome, Average Battery back up upto 10hr( playing game,social media,camera etc ),HOT DESIGN (Premium Glassy)Little Cons : Better front camera,Battery backup (but wrap charge is ultra fast,took 1hr 10mins  to full charge),Come on man ...one plus is always a beast..better than 7t and all other oneplus phones.coz of this insane Display.."
554,"hi ,Pros:Displaycons:Less battery life , can't take fast pics coz three cameras but good picsBit heavy phonehmmm immersive display so pro of display will rule off restSo don't think much i have thought too much  for 4 months and bought finally but it's worth it guysAs compared with samsung s6 and this is better"
555,"just not able to finish the setup process and its heating like crazy.Didnt expect this from OnePlus7 Pro, its highly frustrating"
556,"The phone is awesome after around two updates the camera quality goes better and the fingerprint reader is accurate and fast.Display is awesome and crisp colours are observed. Battery life at first will be somewhat less but as phone adjusts to the usage, the battery life will go up."
557,"A great device with great specs.The display is simply great and now I don't feel like using any other device after using this display.Oxygen OS is fantastic.Warp Charge is very Handy.The camera is also great, although a bit confusing in some aspects.Now runs on Android 10.I couldn't ask for anything more."
558,"Every thing is good with this machine, it works too fast ... That is unbelievably quick ..... Moving to camera  it is not top notch but you can get good pictures with it ...other than that it is an awesome phone I am experiencing for th 4 th month and to this day it hasn't disappointed me . Kudos to you ..., It's edge screen is an eye catching feature that people will admire.Ps: I was using galaxy grand duos and switched to this just this year and everything in it is worth the money"
559,"Beware, the back glass will cracks itself within 2-3months on its own even using the proper case. Check yourself the one plus support community thread , numerous cases are listed with same problem with same pattern . One plus plus just another mediocre quality smartphone company"
560,"I got this phone 3days back and I must say it was best choice I made. Be it iPhone or Samsung non can beat One Plus pro 7 . The most beautiful phone at present. 5 out of 5 star and a big thumsup to all OnePlus products. It's super amazing. Be it display, performance, battery, user experience, touch n feel etc. Go for it guys if you looking for phone on this segment. Chuck the Samsung n iPhone. OnePlus is the new smart."
561,"I absolutely love this phone. Its unbelievably fast, the screen is brilliant and speakers are great too.I was using the pixel 2 XL before and camera in the one plus 7 pro doesn't match up to it. That's the only drawback I have found so far but the camera really isn't all that bad. It's not amazing but it's not a bad camera either."
562,Too highly priced...Poor BatteryNot a value for money product
563,"First off all I have been a apple user all these years and this is my first Android and it is the best choice I have made.!! And me being a photographer infins a pink tint on the photos that I click. I don't know if it's the wat how the pics are or the model has a defect, will have to check on that. But over all as per my I feel this is the upgraded and enhanced version of iPhone."
564,This product was for gaming and speed camera not good battery life is not good over hipped phone is this not a valu for money phone u go and buy OnePlus 7 is bettar than this  .samsung s10plus better than this phone i have s10 plus also
565,"Before OP7pro i used OP5T it's also greatBut OP7PRO is have Excellent battery life in normal use its gives 8 hours and in heavy use its give minimumly 5.30 hoursCamera is better than averageFingerprint scanner is awesome it's work even when my fingers wet ,just sometimes loseOverall best phone of the 2019Love to use it"
566,"Initial impression, consuming lots of energy and battery is getting drained soon.Felt portrait mode photos are not up to the mark compared with other photos takenFingerprint recognition takes more time"
567,"Overall the phone is awesome, as mentioned by OnePlus it's the speed you need this phone actually delivers the speed you need. But somethings are not upto the mark such as it's fingerprint sensor many a times it does not work properly and does not recognize the fingerprint, camera is not upto the mark as expected by a phone worth ‚Çπ53000/- and battery life is more or less okay I haven't felt like charging it again before going to sleep."
568,I have been using OnePlus devices for the past 3 years and I like everything about their phone specially the Oxygen OS. Battery life is well improved in this one including the camera and after a few updates camera is really awesome.
569,Sometimes the mobile gets blinking in blue colour and also getting noise in both the right and left side edges while making incoming or outgoing calls. It is making irritation. Kindly advise to rectify such technical issues
570,"Now After few month if using one plus 7 pro i can honesty review it. I found this phone better than any othe phone in this class. Processor rund very smoothly, camera and video quality is the best."
571,Everything is very well optimised. Build quality is perfect and display is awesome. Oxygen os is way better than stock android.The only downside although a minor one is the battery capacity which should have been atleast 5000 mah instead of 4000.
572,"Just love it, 90Hz Refresh rate is pretty epic. One of the best screens I ever used on a Smartphone. Such a huge display with so good colours and everything is pretty good. This feels like a futuristic smartphone. Looking for more phones like this. Only downside would be the front camera which beautifies everything. Not good for video calling, Other than that selfies are still dope. <3"
573,The product does not have a earphone with it. Recorder is not good. Camera and speed of processing is excellent
574,"My first OnePlus device( THE best Android device). Only two things to bothered about; One is that the phone is way to slippery to use it without any gear. Second thing is that the battery life is a bit poor. Bottom line: One of the best mobile phones I've ever used. People, if you have enough money just go for it!"
575,"Good but not worth for such high costNo 5G, wireless charging and camera quality is not as such it was claimed. IP rating not given ie. No waterproof."
576,"Bought this phone on 10th september  but screen got died on 12 days later.. Photo has been attached herewith.. Couldn't  replace the item as well because  the return date expired on 19th september.. Now contacted Oneplus care and they informed they it will be pick up by tomorrow and deliver the same after 1 week..Note : other than this problem, the phone performace is good, best camera as well as good battery backup.."
577,"This is a marvelous piece of engineering by the one plus team. The display is very sharp and crisp whereas the camera takes very clear pictures. There is no compromise with the performance of the phone thanks to the powerful processor. The phone's battery charges up very quickly thanks to warp charge technology. If you are looking for a phone in this segment , you should definitely buy this. You will not regret this purchase."
578,"The phone is a amazing Flagship at such a price. Its truly a flagship killer when compared to an iphone or a Samsung S series at half the price. The is remarkable for its performance and UI all thanks to Oxygen OS and the refresh rate is the best overall. But it still lags that ""on point"" factor for a phone photographer. The battery has its limitations due to its 90hz refresh rate. But last for a day or two on a normal usage."
579,Phone looks great. Phone is bit bigger but that's ok. I wish it would have been of 6 inches just like iPhone. The curved display is super cool. The camera quality is amazing.CONS:1) Battery life. Phone lasts for atmost 6.5hrs of continuous usage.2) Price should have been around 42K. 49K is a huge amount.3) Phone is a bit heavy. One plus should try to minimise the weight.
580,Phone is good. Factory scratch guard are with full of air  bubbles. When trying to call sometimes it's taking more than 5 seconds after touching call and hanging  sometimes. Hope it will be fixed through update.
581,"Phone is sturdy, camera is good but they didn't sent headpjone, due to different connector my regular headphones doesn't work. Really very sad due to headphones."
582,Too much large to carry in ur pocket...not handy...worth for money...but better to go for Samsung if u can spend more...
583,I am using this phone from last 9 months and from six months every thing which is on screen constantly like battery symbols and every thing on that line embosed on screen permanently and fingerprint symbol is also visible every time i am using instagram so frequently so instagram symbol is also i on screen permanently it's like tattooed on screen I am very disappointed by that I need refund or u can replace my phone
584,This is my 2nd oneplus device first was 3T and I bought 6T for my brother and now I bought 7 pro. Very nice phone with fast indisplay fingerprint reader. And the new update of os bring the camera to another level. 90hz refresh rate is very smooth as butter. Overall it's a great phone that you can find in 2019 june
585,"Finger print reader is a bit slow, and sometimes it doesn't even recognize my thumb,face recognition is fast(slow compared to oneplus 7 because of popup,but it's fast)..camera is awesome,battery lasts for full day, screen is awesome,speakers are awesome,One thing that is not good is that it supports only few apps for dual apps.so you need to download parallel space to run themOverall phone is very good:)"
586,Battery life is  quite good. Phone is excellent. I have 12 GB RAM varrient which is very smooth while playing games. Camera is also good but not best one plus should have take attention about this and solve imideate please. Headphone jack also missing so it's extra cost of money. Overall performance is very good. Thanks
587,Camera requires little updateStill don't get guaranteed exchange price email after deliveryPhn is Lil bit heavy
588,"Worst experience. Phone didn't even boot, once I unboxed. I had to rush to the service centre as I had exchanged my phone and had no other phone to use. Service centre executive said due to new software update the phone didn't start, and they installed the update. Next day morning WiFi wasn't working properly and I had to return the phone back to the service centre and request for a replacement."
589,"Been using one plus 5t. Now switched to 7pro. Never lags. Camera placements are just good, not like the one plus 7t. Camera is good. Not wow. Not pixel like. But still it will amaze you. Battery backup is quite good. I won't say excellent. But, even after my rough use, it has some charge left at the day. And, I am kind of heavy user. I will be using Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter and all, so I use pretty good amount of that screen. But, it's still left with some juice at the end of the day."
590,Worth every single rupee. I have observed that other brands tends to get slower and laggy  with the time. First few months all looks good but things changes with time .This is not the case with OPO. Its buttery smooth and keeps going like that . I am a OPO user since first generation of this brand and never faced any issue of any kind with one plus.
591,"Phone is Heavy, slippery and Fragile. Just after one month, the phone slipped out of my formal trousers while I was sitting on a chair and hit the ground. The screen broke even though it was in proper cover and is Gorilla Glass 5. Screen replacement is very expensive - Rs 16500. Since the screen is curved, it makes the phone even fragile."
592,Super fast...nothing like that. I have 12 Gb Ram but I think 8Gb should also be fine. Mine is extremely fast. It charges in  just 1 hr which is awesome.  This is robust and elegant. I flaunt it too :)
593,"Like- 1)display resolution,2) pop up camera,3)super speed processer,4)Dolby sound,5) fast fingerprint and face unlock.6)Curved edge.7) wrap chargingDislike-1) battery life2) wireless charging3) No headphones4) cost  of phone5) phone doesn't support remote app like peel remote for all the electronics devices"
594,The Perfect Smartphone.Fluid AMOLED display with the 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone buttery smooth.Snapdragon 855 makes sure to maintain the balance between performance and day to day tasks.Warp Charge doesn't make you miss Wireless charging as the charging speeds are just insane.Overall. This is a perfect Smartphone for anyone.
595,Pro1. Screen is amazing2. Phone never feels like lagging3. Great camera qualityConSometimes pop up camera comes out in pocket when face unlock is set
596,"If i am Buying a 50k+ phone and after that i have to spend 6k+ to get the original earphones from oneplusThis is not satisfactory, you should include the earphone price and start selling it with the phone with all the accessories.Understand this we do not have all the time to buy phone and accessories separately.Its very unconvincing :("
597,the phone is excellent. Quality of the screen and the camera are awesome. Only issue i see is the pop up camera and when you use it with face recognition. But thats not a big deal since the finger print reader is lighteining fast.
598,The phone is buttery smooth. No question on the performance side at all. Haven't got any lage issue yet. The battery life is too good and to be honest o didn't expect it to be this good. In one charge it will give you battery life for 1 and half day and in case if your mobile data is off it will give you 2 days and this is a real time experience. And the display is the main attractions of the phone.
599,"It's best to avoid purchasing from DARSHITA ELECTRONICS as initially the phone would not setup, it seemed to have a technical glitch. I found that out by contacting the oneplus company directly, they helped me out. Anyways stay away from DARSHITA ELECTRONICS as they sell defective pieces."
600,i used so many flagship phones ...bt seriously this one is beast ...... completely awesome device...the interface is Damm cool and the feature of the side button to silent and vibrate the phone is perfect üëå.....the display of 90 hz is good nd the sound quality is also nice .....must buy this device .....worth of money!!!!
601,As i am a oneplus fanI am disappointedBattery is a very major issue in oneplus 7 pro1. charging my phone 2 times a day2. heating problemAnd i've been using oneplus since oneplus 5i can tell you that even while charging phone never  got heated before.All i can say is it depends on your usagei get 6 hours on screen timefor others an hour or two might add but still not worth it.
602,"Gifted it to my wife , and now while using my POCO F1 I'm one jealous husband ! Immensely beautiful display , flawless performance , premium looks and what not !"
603,One of the best phone I have ever used.Superb screen specially edge.Great cameraBatteryPerformanceEverything is goodEven in this the indisplay finger print is fast than 6t
604,What a product from such an aweson company ... Just all I want to say keep the up the good work ups good product ups aweson product... Simply in love with this device... Big congratulations to one plus tech team you need big bow....
605,"I am using this phone for last 20 days.Performance of phone is marvelous as well as camera is good as compare to other flagship phones in this range, stability in video is quite good.Overall phone is packed will all necessary things we need in aphone from speed to battery and camera to performance"
606,"The phone's great. The packaging however, was horrible. The edges of the box were out of shape."
607,"It's been an year using this phone.Sometimes in the starting phone unlocked with other people fingerprint too.But later with updates it got fixed.Phone is good.Camera is not as excellent. Clicking sun shows streaks of light,otherwise phone is excellent"
608,90hz quad hd screen is awesome.Screen navigation is like buttery smoothSnapdragon 855 performing goodCharging speed is very good with wrap chargeCamera quality is good but not bestOverall very good flagship for this price range.
609,"Great device! Great optimization of Oxygen OS with the hardware! Premium looks! Phone is heavy in hand! Camera is OK!  Wonderful screen of 90Hz! Ferrari like processor! Good battery life! Fast charging! Only worried about their after sales service,  heard that they charge heavy on hardware fault!"
610,"i started using this phone snice a week now, the product is really great, but the camera quality didnt meet my needs and expectations , and if we play games for 15mins or charge the phone its getting red hoti dono what is the problem behind it but my 6t was better"
611,OnePlus 7pro is a good performance Phone.. it's fingerprint reader is good...camera is excellent... especially nightmood. But I found something missing in camera...is motion stabilization... Battery life is good it last a day with single charge...and fast changing is amazing.Overall an excellent Android phone for android lovers.
612,"Pros: Speed, screen, oxygen OS, camera, fast chargeCons: battery life, parallel apps only for few apps, no audio jack.Atleast one plus would have provided type C ear phones like Samsung provides in the box.Overall slightly costly.I paid Rs.80 for 2 day guaranteed delivery. They took 2 extra days for my delivery. Delivery agents purposefully made 1 ring phone call and showed that he attempted the delivery. Amazon should look into such loop holes."
613,"The company is not providing C cable to 2.0mm adaptor ,we are paying a good amount to own this product still if you feel that's something is still missing then it's definitely means that the product is not value for money, either earphones or converter is must in the box...but sorry it's not there... really disappointing"
614,"Phone is awesome, could have done better with camera, delivery is awefull, it took almost a week to deliver the product. And even the vendor cheated me by excluding the bullets which are free with the product and one plus site also confirming the same."
615,"Quite the stunner in terms of looks and feel. Premium doesn't begin to capture it. The 90 Hz refresh rate is simply awesome. The oxygen os is superior to stock android. Battery life is sufficient for a day of moderate use. The 30 w warp speed charge is sensational..50% in 20 mins is wow. Camera is very good but not the best. On the whole, it's met expectations and then some."
616,"Overall I am very happy with the phone, excellent display and battery life. The only disappointment was in the fifth day of using the phone the selfie camera got stuck and phone was dead after that. Had to do a hard reset after that. That is the reason why I gave a 4 star for the camera."
617,"With the 7 Pro, OnePlus takes a huge step towards establishing itself as a mass market player. The new OnePlus flagship has an excellent display, offers assuring battery mileage, has improved cameras, and delivers perhaps the best performance on the Android side of the table."
618,It's an excellent product. Camera quality with 48 MP is great and captures very real looking image. Frot camera is also decent enough. 8 GB Ram is also effective in terms of providing quick user interface and multi tasking. The only issue with the device is audio jack which is a c type and difficult to procure. One plus should add on the earphones
619,"Fastest fingerprint reader, Do i need to mention camera quality?!!, Battery life is still low, little bit heavy but if they gave you thismuch you can ignore it. Gaming experience is awesome, not getting that much heat while playing games and charging, screen protection is little issue because not found any perfect working screen glass, But at this rate it's better than Best"
620,"Undoubtedly, the best smart phone in the market. It can rival the iPhones and Galaxys . Very fast and very powerful phone. This is the best phone anybody can buy for this price. Go ahead , you shall be happy with your purchase decesion"
621,Decent Phone but just too expensive as the performance . Fingerprint doesn't recognize many times. Camera is okies .. pixel has way better camera quality . Battery life is also ok with the only + is the wrap charge
622,"Camera quality will get better with upcomming updates I believe.Display is the best ever.One full charge will give you around 4-5 hrs of screen on time, if you are playing games and all. If not playing games more than 6 hrs of screen on time."
623,It is awesome.... Just order itValue for moneyBest fluid displayTouch is so smoothBest cameraWrap charger so fast
624,No durable screen guard available in the market. I have tried three-four but non of them sticks perfectly and looses sticking ability. So within three weeks gorilla glass got a scratch. Overall performance wise a class apart phone.
625,There is no good screen guard available.  3days without a screenguard and loads of scratches. I am putting a smaller screen guard to save it from scratches.wrote to oneplus but no response
626,Overhiting
627,"Very Good Performance, some improvements required in fingerprint reader."
628,Just after 10 days phone becomes dead neither it is fallen nor comes under water it's automatically stops working and not switching on
629,"Phone is heavy but once you start using it, you will be okay with that. Phone doesnot have 3.5mm audio jack and one plus does not provide ear phone with the mobile. So you have to spend extra bucks for earphone.Mobile usage is fast,fingerprint unclock is superb and also camera quality is good. Doulby sound is awsome, which makes one plus 7pro better device in case of sound."
630,Make no mistake just go for it if you can afford it. And now when 7t pro is around the corner you can still buy it and can avail discounted price. Best from oneplus so far. Buttery smooth premium look and feel. Super performance and after few updates  camera is also clicking some nice photos. Highly recommended.
631,"I purchased this phone on 9th Dec, phone is very Good , Display is really awesome, only small regret about battery.... Display should be take care... camera is awesome...Thank you."
632,Fingerprint reader is fast and smooth but if you press your finger either from a bit left or right side then it fails to match..It matches well only if you put your finger straight onto the readerDevice is really fast and smooth no lag no crash nothing but sometimes you miss audio jack(very rarely) and in this price company should atleast give earphones.
633,"OP 7 Pro is an awesome phone. Premium phone with very good build quality, flagship hardware backed up by a equally good software at reasonable price. It offers amazing experience and feels worth for money spent."
634,"Got 8/256 almond for slightly less than 40k and believe me, this is a truely awesome fone by all means. haptic feedback, 90hz refresh rate, blazing fast speed, warp speed charging and the list goes on. Cover quality is good. Screen guard might not be very effective but it will work if fone is handled with care."
635,Best display I have ever used.60hz you will feel like a lag after using 90hz OnePlus 7 proAnd phone charges very fast.It's all good features packed in one deviceEven the fingerprint scanner is faster.
636,Good phone too by the way but display is amazing wish they had included earphone jack or atleast a dongle which is a cheap trick for money and the cover inlcuded is below average
637,"phone is build to feel premium,screen is nothing like u hv ever seen before,with constant updates the ph and camera are more functional than ever.. one plus flagship of its own .so u know what u r getting...but p.s if you reading the reviews to buy it ...dont buy it."
638,"As OnePlus phones are always very innovative in their design but this time the phone is bit heavy also phone can't be used single handed also Screen Gaurd is not appropriate it comes with air inside it when I unbox the phone, finger print scanner is not that fast as physical scanner.Notification light which used to most important part of any smartphone in this budget is missing."
639,"It just gets u addicted. I mean I m a iPhone xs user but the smoothness n display.. Omg... U'll definitely fall for it.. Moreover it charges so fast n stays workable for a considerably longer time, just awesome. U gotta use it to kno it, that's all I gotta say."
640,"Pros:(1) Awesome Screen experience(2)Dolby Atmos sound quality(3)Camera quality is very good,not bad at all,as described by a many(4) Super fast refresh rate(5) Super fast charging...gives enough juice for 2 days moderate useCons:(1)A tad bulky,not single hand user friendly(2)No type-c earphones provided(3)No Type-c to 3.5 adapter provided"
641,One plays has come a long way from being a flagship killer to be itself a flagship device. Loved the phone.l build quality design. Was confused between s10plus and this phone. Glad I chose one plus 7 pro.
642,Very heavy. Getting heated up very soon. Charging takes more time. I wonder if I shy go for replacement
643,"pure Chinese phone.camera like 8k phone... realme 5 is betterfinger print censor ohk ohk not bestbattery  8hrs lifesound like 2007 Chinese phone , no bass loud unrialastic soundover all deserve 1star..."
644,Best camera... Except the back camera portrait feature which zooms the image automatically...Good baatery life... Great looks... High end processor which makes the phone smooth... Although fingerprint is slow than previous version.... All feels good no complains so far
645,Phone is extremely good but there is some problem during phone calls.The person on the other side hears echo of his voice while on call.This happens in all calls.
646,"It's Display is excellent. Camera and Battery is good. I am using it for my personal use, for wating tv streams, youtube, browsing  and other social media apps.It's really butter smooth...I am Happy."
647,Phone is defective.  The phone icon & massage  icon do not function.  It does not hold & instantly blinked  off even sim card is inserted  properly.
648,"I feel disappointed it's not worth for the money. It's hanging a lot. the camera application isn't responding correctly and also I need to wait for 30 to 40 seconds in most of the apps like whatsapp,  insta and also amzon, most of the time it closing automatically showing phone is not responding.i am going for exchange, hopefully the new phone wont be having such problems."
649,Did i really need to write a review??ü§îü§î everybody knows how good is oneplus devices. The display of this device..oh my god..the best display in any phone. no comparison with others. Battery backup is a bit on low side..normal use will give only one day battery backup. heavy use you have to take that warp charger twice a day atleast.
650,This phone is the best you can get for that pricing
651,No doubt phone is great but the biggest drawback of 6gb variant is that the RAM Management is terrible. Phone itself uses about 3.5-4 GB of RAM out of 5.7 GB. There's no use of performance when this phone cannot manage the ram properly. You only get get 1.7 GB RAM for the apps. Battery drains faster than expected even when I'm not using phone.
652,No one can beat one plus product IAM the fan of one plus since one plus 2
653,"The best phone with all the features. I highly recommend OnePlus phones to all. Camera quality & Battery backi is amazing, and You do not have to wait for a longer time to get your phone charged. With the wrap charger your phone gets charged really quick."
654,"I am very disappointed with this mobile.Camera is Hanging sometimes.App's like WhatsApp - is fluctuating mostly, while chatting automatically profile is coming &chat box is getting disappeared.Heating problem."
655,I bought this before some time and after using Im giving review now with my proper experience in each and everything it is so good to play mobile games like PUBG and it also comes with good storage and it also has unique functionality and many more things.
656,"I had ordered the phone exactly on the day of release, so it's been 2 months that I am using this phone. I totally love this phone, 90fps is so good that it puts all other phone way behind. I just wish OnePlus would improve in camera department as the camera isn't as good as pixel phones but installing Google camera in the phone improves the picture quality."
657,Best phone in that price range
658,"Flagship killer finally turned out to be a flagship,but too short to meet flagship guidelines. Biggest downside is camera. Not at all at par when compared with s10/Apple xs. Carl should revive the pricing once again and refund fairly reasonable amount. Happy with performance but not at this premium price.  You guys have gotten wrong price"
659,"Camera doesn't commit to the hype.A flagship killer is expected to perform better with camera.Othwri, it's with every penny you pay. üíú"
660,"The battery life I am facing is not that good. SOT is around 4.5 - 5hrs only. With 4000mah battery I have expected more. The camera has improved a lot with the update I received quickly. Still, it needs more refining."
661,No doubt that One plus devices has very fast finger print scanner..Camera has still some bugs especially front camera ..on selfie Objects shows very closer to cam.batterly depends on our usage but no worries it has super fast and great warp charge....Only minus thing is mechanised pop-up camera...Pinch hole may be nice.
662,"Phone is flickering, suddenly going blank, other apps are getting opened automatically when we are talking.Request to send a technicaan to check the mobile and need an replacement immediately.This is intoleraable"
663,This phone is stunning. Just a lil bit heavy but at this screen ratio everything is just perfect. And in nebula blue it's stunning believe me.
664,"Very bad expreinced from amazon,defective mobile was sent to me,when i was opened i feel its like used mobile,there are more than 2 bubble are on pre aplied protector ,battry drained in just 15 mnt of starting and android setup time.after long discussion with customer care defective item replace with new one.pls dont buy costly product from amazon."
665,The battery life of this phone is very low.the drain too much fast.the onscreen time is nearly 4to 5 hours only. The mobile network  is carry 2g/3g (automatic) which result mobile donot catch 3g network strongly and this effect the mobile data carrying speed.There should be one more option of only 3g in network selection setting...
666,Excellent. Switched from iphone. Camera not comparable to iphone. But awesome. One or two times suffered app crash too. But that's android problem. Otherwise everything excellent. Battery superb. If not for pubg. It lasts whole day and i can use it freely. And warp charge gives security against discharge.
667,"Very good product from OnePlus with edge HD display, touch screen quality, fine camera clarity, processor speed, Dolby sound effect at good pricing. Go for it. I would strongly recommend this phone to anyone."
668,One_plus always delivers a gem product to it's customersFingerprint reader is fastFace_detection is goodFast wrap chargingBut the front camera quality is not that good in dim lightBack camera is awesomeGaming mode is super.
669,"all over performance is very good , only camera is not like flagshipotherwise screen , performance , build quality A+++"
670,Wow this phone was really awesome . Great gaming phone with excellent features . No gaming phone have this much features and build quality . Really alot of difference is there to oneplus6t and 7 pro dont think about other phones infront of oneplus 7 pro all other mobiles are useless . This is a king of all phones . Thanks to oneplus and amazon ..
671,"After opening phone ,This one screen i am getting from last one hour.Phone is all hang.This is a brand new phone and not able to access it as it's a damaged phone"
672,"No water resistant, but product pdf says water resistant to some extent by this they making us tempt to buy. But finaly dening warranty for water issues.Don' t buy this, oneplus and amazon won't help, all of them simply cheating customers."
673,"It's touch screen is not as good as One+6. It's not even three months, the microphone developed some problem. Other end people were not able to hear me properly."
674,"One plus user since since 6 years ,till now awesome variant ,very smooth screen resolution 90hz is awesome and camera is super ,night mode is exceptionally awesome , no words for this product"
675,"Amazing Product , phone which can suit your every mood , finger print reader operates like a normal touch no additional efforts required , display is simply superb no words , camera quality is excellent and overall look and feel of product is simply marvelous ..."
676,Stands On customer Expectations.Phone is silly fast on 90hz displayCamera is not flagship level though.Built quality is top notch.Weight management is poorBattery backup is good
677,"Great product. I switched from Apple to OnePlus and it feels such a breeze. I would recommend everyone looking to switch from Apple,this phone is great and has a very premium look and feel to it. Honestly this scores above new gen Apple models in all categories whether it is battery life, screen size and clarity etc. Juts go for it worth the price."
678,I like display of this phone and dislike is more because I think I got difective product battery life is not good camera error few seconds and it hanged few times i will apply return or refund
679,"Phone is good specially touchscreen.But i have concern in camara section. When i m trying to click video in slowmotion in led light, screen is flickering continuously and captured light flickering in video also. I am very mych disappointed."
680,Over weight..finger print sensor sucks
681,"After 2months im writing this reviewDon't listen any one if you're having budget for 40k phone just go for it. I have upgraded from i phone x believe ke you will gona love your one plus mobile. Just take care a little bit more its slippery. Osm phone, osm sceen daam u cant remove your eyes. Good battery for this screen."
682,The thing I like about this device is it's blazing fast.......the thing I dislike is absence of headphone jack. There is no such problems of phone not responding and booting problems seen in my device...ThePhone is at its best on all aspects that a flagship has.  IT IS worth upgrading from Oneplus 5t to OnePlus 7proüòçüòçüòç
683,This is fastest phone ever seen before. The only problem in phone is CAMERA quality.  If we look on one side then camera is simply awesome but if we compare with Apple then  it is not good as compare as expected. All over everything else is perfect and 10x bettee then apple.. go and grab
684,üñ§
685,"All clear product. after months I am adding the review.One plus 7pro. I am using.Good battery life,  Finger Print sensor. Regular update. Good camera."
686,Best In Class. Without A Doubt Go For It. 90Hz Refresh Rate makes The Screen So Fluid. This is What Value For Money Feels and Means. The Same Features will come in Samsung If You Spend 20K More ü§£ü§£. Almond Color Is The Best. Waiting For OnePlus TV. As OnePlus is The Best Now. When you use the 90Hz Screen. You Will Don't Like normal 60Hz.
687,"Amazing Product...I was an iPhone user and changed to One Plus 7PRO....it's so fast, touch screen is amazing.. totally in Love with this phone üòò"
688,one of the best smart phone i have ever seen.U can say it is complete package ..just missing 3.5 mm audio jack .. otherwise all is perfect
689,Such a beautiful Phone.. display is crisp. Sound from the stereo speakers is massive and immersive.. cheers to onePlus for such a package in a good price! Definitely would recommend.
690,As of now the best mobile in market i guess is OnePlus 7 pro.Super smoothSuper displaySuper batterySuper cameraI don't think anything in this mobile could be better.Everything is best. Go for it.
691,All good except shipping package and product box .I take the replacement because earlier also i got the same problem of shipping package and product box. Again i got damage box instead of request made regarding this. All good you can buy and its Worth buying product for 53k.......
692,Great phones but most of times apps are getting closed in background even with 12gb RamCamera quality is ok and tele camera quality is bad where there is lot of shift in AWB gains compared to main cameraWide to tele and ultrawide switching can cause flicker may be exposure weights are more for slave cami causing the flicker during switch due to synchronisation of 3A
693,"Amazing experience , camera is better compare to previous versions 6T , dispaly is just lovable , pop up selfie camera also best , best smartphone ever by one plusBattery performance is not that expected because of 90Hz refresh rate"
694,Fastest android phone there is. Few bugs here and there but Oneplus are quick to rectify. Battery life couldve been better but can't complain with that super fast Warp charging. Camera is good enough to take great social media worthy shots.
695,"Over all performance is Excellent,but after 10 days  lines appear in screen,as per check the right product , one plus service center technician tell about this is manufacturers defect,and to return back to Amazon, will get new phone.After complaint Amazon tell about the window is closed within 3 days ....How it is possible...If any small value item will get atleast 14 days..."
696,"The Phone is, as titled, is ""Buttery Smooth"". But, Camera qwality is not good in android 9 so,update to android 10 by local upgrade in system updates section in settings or just wait for patch to show up in system updates."
697,The Oneplus 7 Pro is a typical OnePlus phone with amazing software experience but what let this product down is its heavy weight and as usual average camera. It is quite a heavy product which is not at all manageable with its big size.
698,"Bad experience!!!!The NO COST EMI facility is just to make fool, they didn't convert the ammount to emi.I am facing this. And I will never do any kind. Of shopping from this site. And the support team is also very pathetic & disappointing"
699,Love it....Pure performance ..Beast
700,"Good things :-Looks great, smooth interface, pretty fast multi-tasking, nice display, curved display, fast changing, good camera quality and battery life.Bad things :-Phone weight, finger print does not work sometimes, suddenly Bluetooth disconnects automatically sometimes,"
701,"Have been a one+ user since one+2 launch. 7 pro is overall good phone, only shortcoming is 3.5 mm earphone jack slot missing."
702,This phone started to hang while using routine apps like WhatsApp. The curved screen is just useless and it's super sensitive to touch unlike Samsung. It's just not worth spending nearly 50k.
703,I was happy when i bought my mobile one plus 7 pro ..now iam surprised i have spend lits of money on this crap phone camera quality got worst ever even vivo oppo has better camera with this
704,"Do not compare OnePlus7 with OnePlus7 Pro. I repeat do not.This phone is far more superior than 7 in all aspects. Be it a camera, display, sound, touch or battery. That's why the name pro.Just Sometimes touch doesn't responds well after multiple ""fingerprint reader"" failures. üò¨"
705,"The phone is very snappy, but the camera performance is average as of any other budget phones. May be it can be improved with image processing algorithms improvement, and sometimes it starts to lag like really really hard. That's mostly because of its smart ram management. Rest the phone is outstanding"
706,worst phone..stopped working after 1 month of use..hangs a lot..camera stopped functiining after 4 months.
707,Hey guys just got it before 4 days ago. I cant say anything because it does prove that GO BEYOND SPEED. Everything is perfect. Really looks like a premium mobile. Thank you oneplus. Satisfied. Just go for it without any thinking if you are thinking between SAMSUNG S10+ and this one.
708,"Not buy because  very fast dicress rate this OnePlus mobile‡•§I bought OnePlus 7pro on 6 June 2019 6 ram 256 49999after 4 month October in49999‡•§all round OnePlus 7pro is very cool and faster mobile phone good screen quality,very good sound Dolby digital, overall nice"
709,I have been using OnePlus since 3 and till date my OnePlus 3 is working perfectly fine so yes OnePlus have maintained the quality and software support is always awesome.
710,Finger print works faster and camera is pretty gud and battery drain when you put 90hz frame rate and QHD display. The smartphone is very fastest.
711,"Screen is awesome, speed is great but fingerprint sensor and touch sensitivity is not that great. Camera is average as it doesn't click 48mp all yhe time and you have to manually selext it everytime by going to pro mode."
712,Really it's too good.. I didn't expect this level of quality.. product quality is too nice.. Fully satisfied.Go for it.
713,"Been using the phone for more than a month now. Exceptional build quality, beautiful aesthetics and practically the best phone I've used. Everytime I take it my phone, people are amazed by it's full screen display and it's beautiful looks. Love the OnePlus brand."
714,Nothing to say about this phone! perfection in all areas! was impressed with the 6 and 6T but this...... just WOW!
715,"A must buy smart phone, but only one issue which I have faced with one plus 7 pro, camera quality,Main camera is ok ok but wide camera and 3x zoom camera quality is not good. They work like 10 k mobile camera. Rest all are okA butter like mobile phone."
716,"I'm using this phone from past 1 month, It has given a ultimate performance. It felt bit heavy in initial days other than that I didn't find any issue with the phone."
717,"- Build quality is top notch.- Screen is one of the best in the industry right now. - Camera is the only department keeping away OnePlus below Apple & Samsung.- Even then recommended above Samsung flagships.Congratulations OnePlus !!Now, a race towards Apple !!"
718,"The camera quality in pro mode distorts the images on the sides. Only selfie camera seems satisfactory. Camera adds too much colour to the photos. When the photos are viewed on media other than OnePlus phone, the photos seem dull"
719,The network connection of this phone is very bad. Phone got disconnected . Facebook messenger always shows connecting . Facebook games always get disconnected in the middle .It is so frustrating to use this phone .I am sure Amazon sell faulty phone .
720,"Had great experience using this phone, I changed the screen refresh rate from 90hz to 60hz and hadlly experienced any difference. Overall had a great experience with this phone. I will definitely recommend to anyone"
721,The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the camera quality.Everything else is beast
722,everything thing is superb.. one plus is boss no doubt...2 things want to convey after usage of 2 months..first i felt heaviness of the phone andsecond rear camera portrait feature is not up to the mark as compared to one plus 7
723,Disturbance and unwanted noise during all incoming and outgoing calls. Phone when putbon speaker works fine but when using system phone it is absolutely waste
724,Very smooth to operate. Build quality is excellentOnly one thing which might need a little improvement is its UI
725,"This is one of the worst experience, this phone has a lot of hanging issue one plus 5 is far better than this even after complaining and showing it to th service center nothing happened and they said there is issue with some handset but didn't exachange it."
726,"First word, pethitice product trying to boot first time and Phone is not starting giving error message see attched screenshot.i tried lots of time. When i called amazon they are saying inspection will conduct after 3 days, then they will decide.. i want my money back..pethetic service from amazon"
727,"Battery is the issue as it drain rapidly I think 4hrs of screen use  with 90hz massive display but that's the price you pay for awesome display , a beast phone total badass"
728,I just my new phone yesterday and the camera sucks i even called the customer care  and told her the same problem i am facing about the camera but through the diagnostic app check they say its fine check the granules pixels blurring around the image by zooming it.I want a replacement for my product immediately
729,Had great expectations.. But very sad.. This is not the true One Plus.. I have been using one plus 5T And it if still super fast. Feel very bad why did I go for this handset. Was carried away with the paid media. Dear  Amazon.. PLS Take it back.
730,I was told this phone is splash proof. It doesn't work that way. My phone is not working within a few months of my purchase. I got drenched in rain once while the phone was in my pocket and its not working now. Can i expect a better product from amazon or not?
731,"Firstly, I do not like the colour at all. It seems like a phone for the elderly. Secondly, apps crash quite frequently.I have always been a fan of OnePlus and this is my third OnePlus phone. However, this phone has been giving me some issues."
732,"it's running good, after android 10 update, screen recording not running smoothly, it was good with android 9 pie. otherwise very good."
733,Very bed
734,ProsVery good performance overallRam is fastConsShould have pocket modeSelfie camera pics are not good
735,Better than s10 plus...Camera quality is getting better overtime with updates...
736,Awesome features but price can be little be lesser than what it isAs not much difference between other one plus varient.
737,Awesome
738,"Previously I have one plus 5 .but I think that was better option in terms of performance , camera , battery, easy to carry (hold)  etc .One plus 7pro  look wise it's really gud but other things all not that's much great"
739,"All the good things they say are true. The only problem i have: maybe I didn't scan my fingers right, but it doesn't read from certain angles, I had to scan the same finger as another fingerprint."
740,"Like  speed, lag free,ease of useDislike  poor camera compared to others like Samsung note 8, s9 s10,  very slippery in hand, heavy"
741,"I was watching and waiting patience for the right upgrade in the one plus phone lineup, very glad to take a decision for the upgrade and now so happy seeing the phone in my hand. But also sad that i had to give the legacy one plus one phone from where it all started."
742,Camera outdoor superb -Indoor feels blurry and less detailing in imagesPerformance superb üëçPackaging little bit unsatisfiedoverall performance satisfied with good battery backupDisplay smootherGreat build quality üí™
743,Fastest phone I'm ever used
744,"Best phone from Oneplus. I am totally in love with this phone. I was going for redimi k20 pro, but must say the quality of camera in oneplus is far more better. Delivery from Amazon was so fast, thanks amazon!! Highly recommended"
745,Excellent phone for normal usage but not for gaming. The OLED display can cause burn in if you use on full brightness or continuously playing games for hours
746,It's been 6 months I have bought this product it is worth buying...I have bought this phone in exchange offer where I exchanged my redmi note 7 pro. Battery life is quite good. Camera is awesome. Features are very good. Kudos to One Plus.
747,Save 5 to 6 k and go for 7pro instead of 7t Pro
748,After using 4 daysI can say that phone looks classic but it's bit heavyCamera quality is superb display is excillentBut disappointing is the battery backupFinger print 5out of 5 face unlock 5 out of 5Over all nice phone
749,"One of the best, highly optimized smartphone available in the market, Hands down Go for it, you won't regret.Once u get addicted to this blazing fast beast you won't be using other phones 'casue those will be to slow for you. #SpeedIsAddictive"
750,"The product was fine and most functions are working alright, it would have been better to have a wireless headset considering the price being paid and the screen protection installed has air bubbles"
751,Excellent product. Except for one issue. It reboots automatically 3 to 4 times a day. Solution suggested is to reformat the phone.
752,overall everything is good. but randomly phone is not responding some times. lagging issue is there. i have did factory reset and all possible solution but still facing issue. I have spend a lot money but feeling like is it oneplus ?  customer support says will repair your phone.
753,"Camera quality is not good compare to I phone model 7, finger print need to improve more some times it was not recognise prop ally and lake time to press multiple times, even given proper fingerprints multiple times"
754,Every thing is good about phone.for one plus lovers it's awesome upgraded phone for gaming and movies you can opt this but for battery and camera it's good but not the best
755,Mobile got automatically dead in 2 months... Without any problem.... Very disappointed in one plus.... Not gonna buy one plus again... Don't buy it folks.. it's not worthy..
756,"Super fast, I have used so many premium phones in my life but the OnePlus 7 pro just have the wow factor. Been using it for couple of months now and the speed on this phone has made me an addict ."
757,"My mobile OnePlus 7pro 12GB RAM,256GB ROM on display vertical green lines appeared."
758,"Without a shadow of doubt, it's one of the best phone out there. Camera is really good, though they can still make it better. Kudos to OnePlus for launching such amazing products. #OnePlusFan #OnePlusFam"
759,It's indeed one of the best if not the best of best model but I feel it still can be improved which we are waiting to see in 7T or next model..Overall value for money 10/10Camera 6/10Performance 9/10Battery life 8/10 and charging speed 10/10
760,Excellent phone but i don‚Äôt prefer to use face unlock. Because it may get damage if it keeps on popup and battery is goodBut phone is little big to fit in your pockets
761,I have OnePlus 6T I order this one for my father I checked it with mine all the features are bested and the fingerprint sensor is faster than the ones which have fringedprint reader
762,It's one the best smartphone some say go for 7 but if can save few extra bucks this the one u should purchase. At the end of day always have 20% even after using bluetooth headphones. Camera quality is very nice and the best part is the screen which is uncomparable.
763,Beast in this range üí™üòçSmooth with emersive display
764,"One Plus 7 pro cell is nice but with some cons like its weight,battery back up less ,camera not good and its very long."
765,Excellent product
766,Phone is very very good.Display output good.Nice speakers audio output.battery very fast charge.But battery very fast discharge.Not*please I want oneplus 7 pro bullet Bluetooth earphones where purchase please tell me.
767,Sometimes fingerprint may slow or take time to detect than other cheaper phones. But pop up camera and face lock work good.
768,Battery kife is not that good..And face unlock is fast but not that much safe..One of my friend unlocked my phone by face unlock...And there are some small bugs which are needed to be fixed and oneplus is doing their job well... At last GREAT PHONE..
769,"A phone cannot be better than this one. Speechless!!! One small problem is the weight of the phone. -Dhiman mazumdar, Guwahati"
770,Worst expriencePhone is not startingShowing Qualcom Crashdump ModeVery bad service from amazon technician visit fixed after 3 days
771,"Excellent smart phone, can't keep the phone idle, thanks to the makers.... My third Oneplus... 2>3>7."
772,"This is my 3rd mobile from Oneplus , I can only describe Just one in word about this mobile, ""Beautiful""."
773,"The phone is just ok. At this heavy price I won't recommend. Cemera battery performance just ok. Mobile gets heated not only in charging but while using the phone too. If you get 4-5 calls one after other, it will be heated. Don't go for brand name."
774,Overall.. amazing phone.. the front camera isn't that great.. But the back camera is amazing.. Fingerprint upto the mark.. processor and performance is a beast.. straight gaming pubg for two hours and not even a single lag or glitch..Go for it
775,"Sexy phone, awesome display best camera performance. Battery size could be some more anyways it charge fast so acceptable.Feel-good click awesome happy with my purchase.Thanks Amazon üëç"
776,Best displaySuper cameraGood batteryNice designOnly problem I am feeling is while talking on call sometimes unnecessary touch.I hope it ll resolve with software update
777,I expected it to be 45k. However the phone is awesome. The HDR plus mode is the best. My fav place to watch Netflix.  Minus 1 star for the extra 5k. I was worried about the size but it was fine for me.
778,Unhappy with the phone. Finger print does not work most of the time. Phone hangs often. In Facebook photos don't open even after double tap.
779,iam happy with the phone but initially it did not work properly(cracking voice) with Vodafone sim so I had to port my number to JIo.
780,"Overall it's a great mobile, very fast performance, it's a best mobile, not for compare other Android mobiles"
781,"Oxygen Os is smooth and very fast, Superb Looking Mobile , Screen very smooth, I like carve Display, super fast fingerprint sensor, face Unlock is also very fast, camera quality not bad, battery life is avarage Totally good product"
782,"I am a die hard One Plus fan. I was pretty mesmerized with my One Plus 7 Pro, until it gave me sudden display issue. Vertical lines from top to bottom came up from no where.Will have to go to the service center to get it replaced."
783,Everything is just amazing. iPhone users may not be surprised with the fingerprint reader as it's better in iphone but still it's good. Battery life is not as good as people are exaggerating but still it will last for one day with good usage.
784,What the hell where is 20 min full charge from 0 to 100I have been charging my phone from 1 hr 10 mins nd it only charged from 18 to 80% only
785,Product is good but not durable as it is heavy and one should keep it with safetyOverall phone is very good with all pre loaded features
786,"Awesome phone u ever can buy... Bought it for 39k using bank offer, referral program. In my opinion this is master class for this price range.. solid build, awesome look, performance and it will charge before you realize"
787,It's not perfect for camera it's equal for only redmi k20 pro it's not worth 45000 it's waste 20000 why it's heavy price it's not support wireless charging it's one advantage only it's covered display only waste of money
788,"It is love at first sight experience me. I had been waiting for One Plus 7 T, but it got a bit disappointed with the display and camera set up if 7T. So I went for much attractive 7 Pro adding just 6k more. And I am enjoying this."
789,"Superb phone, first time using such bulky and costly phone. Looks absolutely premium and works very smoothly.Played pubg on this mobile with Gaming mode ON, gaming felt so effortless and visuals where so rich and made me happy."
790,"Overall build quality is not as publicized, Fingerprint sensor not fast as mentioned, user experience not as otherhigh-end phones."
791,This is the best phone one can have. The only issue i am facing is with respect to battery life. After full charge i am getting battery backup of only 12-14 hours. Something is not right here.
792,"At first the finger print reader would work slow, not that I got used to, but it's inbuilt adaptive learning algorithms make it faster over the time. Camera works well. Overall pretty awesome."
793,Phones good.. wish they supplied a type-c headphones with it. Phone is snappy in terms of opening apps and while scrolling it's like butter smooth... Battery life is avg depending on how you set the mode of display and refresh rate.
794,It's awesome..was in doubt before buying cuz of reviews but trust me.. fingerprint reader won't work if your fingers are dirty... camera is perfect and I'm not even picking my dslr these days now.battery life is decent and gaming is flawless..
795,It is one plus. Only one drawback battery will drain fast when you're using game mode.
796,"The phone is a bit heavy to use and it takes time to get a hang of it but the screen is awesome camera is great  the fingerprint scanner is really very fast and so is face I'd, it have a great four thousand mAh battery life which will easily get you through your day and the charging speed is really great."
797,"Phone is great i really loved it its speed ,camera, gamming everything is ausome l. Just one thing i was disappointed about is charging one plus says it charges in 20 mins but actually it takes around an hour to charge."
798,Good camera in day lite and night lite very good picture come. Battery life too good. Charger is very quick.
799,"Fingerprint reader can be improved which helps the user to avoid more waiting time and when it comes to camera quality it's quite good yet it's being improved and hope would be fine. Other specifications are upto the mark , yet bugs need to be fixed..."
800,"No words to speak about OP7 Pro, Extraordinary Phone, Best Premium smartphone of Oct 2019"
801,Yes it is buttery smooth and feels premium.Display and sound are perfect. Camera needs slight improvement. Software updates can help in improving camera. Still does the job in the camera department. But loving my nebula blue.
802,Battery life is very bad and phone performance is not good same time phone is hinging
803,Really awesome handset. Awesome battery performance.no heating issue. No lagging. I just love it
804,By far my best purchase !!! I switched from pixel 2xl to OnePlus 7 pro 1 week back and only in camera aspect pixel is better in every remaining aspect one plus 7 pro is best go for it !!
805,Finger print reader works well camera quality is good and battery life could have been more better.
806,Phone is start hang
807,Camera quality is very good but battery life is horrible
808,"designing is good; battery life should be extended- 5000 M ah. Finger print sensor is Normal, nothing special about it. Over all Good.  Hope one plus will offer Android update for P."
809,One plus7 pro is amazing phone with curved screen had a lot of expectation to camera. But didnt get the result as i was expecting still this phone deserves 4 star for the rest of all feature especially face recognition.
810,"Its been one month since I am using it. Sometimes the warp charge doesnt work - due to faulty USB cable. Other than that 100% satisfied with the product.  For this much of a price,  they should have included the headphones also"
811,Product was good and fast and awesome  but i request to amazon customer service to dieliever it with proper i have to go to office for riecieving my product.
812,"Phone was used, may be Refurbished .... Beware"
813,"The display itself is enough to buy this phone. Fast, smooth and brilliant to use. Camera has improved drastically.the colors are brilliant and hdr/2k content is a dream to watch"
814,Phone got so heat after 5 min when we talk.
815,Camera is not up to the marksBattery is also draining fastSpeed is superebSound quality is superebCharging speed is goodOverall a good phone.Hope to improve in camera quality in some updates
816,Ive been using this phone and its been a year now.Battery life seems to be down.it decreases speedly but my usage is also high.So its acomplete phone if u are a mediator user.The best among androids for sure.
817,Only concern is OnePlus give local screen guard which gets damaged in 15 days.
818,The touch sensitivity of the figer print reader is not fast and requires multiple attempts but the Camera and Battery is really good at this price range! OnePlus 7 Pro is really a wonderful phone!
819,"An absolute beast of a phone. It is big, bulky and beautiful. Super smooth, no matter how many apps are open."
820,i loved this phone in every aspect. battery life for gaming could be better..
821,Phone is awesome.display is fantasticbut camera lags a lot. images are blurry while taking it in a low light conditions.price is quite high for 6 GB RAM . BUT OVERALL GOOD PHONE
822,One of the best phone in around 43k.Battery & camera are perfectly fineScreen quality is above the world and that 90z is butter smooth.Actually I use OnePlus 3t before buying this phone.But I say this phone is awesome
823,"All rounder of mobiles. Charging speed vry fast.sound quality is superb its Dolby atmos. Front camera video is not good, it's zoomed automatically. Rear camera is pretty good. I liked its curved display.."
824,Very bad box delivery
825,Camera quality is not up the mark. Regarding battery no words to say. Pure blunder taking this phone. Charging very slowly(OnePlus shouldn't call it as dash charging) and battery drains very fast compared to previous models.
826,Camera clearly is superb. But fingerprint reader & face reader don't work properly everytime.
827,"Wow phone.... I love it.Thank you garima, for this beautiful Gift"
828,"After the replacement, the camera is again gone bad.. too much noise in the pictures.Brought the phone only for camera resolution reason as primary, however now disappointed within a year it's again gone bad"
829,Poor quality of Fingerprint reader. Additional expense of buying headphone. Minimum Accessories provided. Poor quality touch screen. Not worth spending that much money. Better phones available in market.
830,Everythings great about this phone. I dont know why Indian people have tendency of writing pathetic things about products. Anyway I love this phone and it is much better than iphone 11 pro in terms of display and performance.
831,If you can get over the fact that the phone is huge and heavy and the camera quality is sort of average. It's a pretty nice option. That display is really game changer. It's really that fluid. And it's performance is top notch.
832,"Once you start using OnePlus, there is no going back"
833,"1. Battery life is average.2. Display is not bright, outdoor visibility is very poor.3. Camera quality is good enough."
834,this handset is not proper workinng any system
835,"Really, the speed surprised me with more than expected. The SD855, 90Hz screen and QHD display are really awesome. Battery optimisation can be done. And WRAP charge is superb."
836,Am a recent change over from iOS to Android ..Must admit .. this is a rock solid competitor to iPhone..My only concern is battery seems to discharge fast on consumption or may be am being used to android
837,The phone is packed with all those futuristic stuff that you need!That 90hz display is where one can get habitat and never use 60hz again anymore!The only issue I had was the phone box was crumpled a but and the scratch guard had a scratch on it in the box!
838,Selfie camera worst only this mobile...I before used OnePlus 6t that camera celerity was superb..I compared another OnePlus 7 pro selfie was superb only this mobile selfie camera only problem...I want replacement
839,"This one plus Is a bit on the heavier side, battery could have been better. But the things that you'll about this phone is the display and the sound quality.Though the camera is a head turner, but it could be improved."
840,A good phone with excellent battery backup... Camera is good but not excellent...
841,"It's been not even a month, I can see dust accumulation in 3x camera. Didn't expect this from a flagship!"
842,Although phone struggled with the fingerprint reader during the first two days. Now it is quite okay.The display is beyond comparable.Improved camera quality and speaker outputOverall quite satisfied.
843,"Using almost 3 months now, excellent camera quality both front and back cameras. Screen clarity is awesome i can say. Only issue is battery life u have to charge two times a day."
844,"Camera quality is awesome üëå, I am writing this review after 3 months of purchasing, earlier the battery backup were good, now the battery is discharging quick, This is happening after updating the software."
845,"Its awesome, no words to say about OnePlus...a great experience....mind blowing...camera, processor, battery backup,touch experience,sound,etc...are fantastic...."
846,"Camera quality is very good after update , finger print reader excellent , Display sooperb... battery backup complete 1 day for avg user...finally 5 rated except battery"
847,Performance is nothing for this beast üí™ camera godbattery good played pub g for 4 hour non stop at HDR setting while recoding gameplay at 1080p Iam realy satisfied with this beast
848,Big network issue in this phone
849,The product came with a defective phone back cover. The customer service at Amazon was bad! And i could not get it replaced.
850,"This device is a beast. Blazing fast, super AMOLED display, super camera, best battery backup with warp charger. It's my third one plus device."
851,A complete package phone by OnePlus as usual. The fingerprint scanner is the fastest and the touch n feel of the screen is superb. The screen is really really awesome.
852,Most elegant and classy look....8+256GB one plus 7pro blue color.Excellent functioning
853,I am very disappointing with OnePlus 7 pro battery... It is drain to fast .. after some analysis the battery going to drain 3 minutes per % with normal usage... Worst battery life ...I am returning this device
854,It's very friendly and super phone in India for Indian customers.this phone is very super and nuce.but screen protector should be provided by one plus.but this is the only drawback.other than that everything is good
855,"Works smoothly without any glitches. Battery life is spectacular. Fingerprint scanner is not very sensitive and could do with some improvement. Camera is exceptional. I love the user interface. Overall, a great buy!"
856,Mind blowing phone at a good priceExcillent cameraMore thn Excillent OSNice curve displayWarp charging is fast in 20 mins u will get 70% of juiceBackup is the only downside of the phone
857,"Camera isn't that good, getting minor lags after 2 months of usage, finger print reader is okOnly good part - screen"
858,Best gaming phone
859,"It's the fastest phone I have ever used. So far loving this phone a lot. Barring the headphone jack, i love everything about this phone"
860,The Mobile wasn't charge properly
861,Camera quality is not that good as compared to OnePlus 5T. It needs improvement. Fingerprint reader is good. Battery life is good but needs charging every day n depends on your phone usage.
862,Best mobile at this price point. I have been a oneplus fan since the first mobile. Keep it up!
863,"I had purchased the device on 24th May and now my handset's back-screen was broken, As per billing there was 1 yrs warranties of the device, Kindly suggest me the procedure to replace or repair the mobile set."
864,It's been an awesome experience with one plus 7 pro.. performance is great .If you have some budget then go for one plus blindly..But my opinion if the camera have a macro lens then it's could be more better..
865,"From the moment I hold this phone in my hands, this phone has exceeded expectations. This is BEYOND SPEED. 90Hz refresh rate is amazing. You can feel the difference."
866,"The phone is just awesome. the looks, its performance, everything.The only con is that there is no earphone jack also the do not provide audio adapter converter like they used to provide it with earlier models."
867,last year i bought this for my sister ... and after complete use I can say this is very good and value for money ....
868,Battery should have been min 4500 mah for such a flagship phone.A very average battery life but apart from this a very good phone.
869,Overall product is good. But scratch guard of phone was nt placed properly on phone bcz of wid when put in cover air was getting into scratch guard. Bill invoice is also nt printed properly. Bad amazon services
870,This is amazing. But I didn't get bullet wireless headset.
871,The battery life is average eventhough the screen resolution is kept to 60HZ with FHD+ mode. Apart from that a good gadget beast which meets all your day today needs!
872,You pay fking 53k and don't get headphones or type C to 3.5 mm adaptor that really annoying.Camera is still average not the best.Battery backup is average too.Too much thicker and heavier too.
873,Love it. Absolutely love it. Better than any other phone in the segment. Zero issues with any feature. Do buy.
874,One among the best phone a have ever used!Totally worth the for the money paid.
875,Battery life is worst and worst not worth of money tooo high cost and the battery doesn't remain for 6hrs I make my battery 100% and check it out after 40min it shows me 80% got bored and bothered
876,Amazon as always delivered the product very fast. The product had a bill and a secure OTP for getting the delivery.No defects in the phone. A charger was given with the phone. Great product.
877,"I was an iPhone user, i have sold it out and bought 1plus 7pro. It is a good value for money.It has all the features that are required in a good android phone. Camera quality is best and it's a power house."
878,"Overall full value for money, Camera is good not so great with this price range Performance is excellent, no hang or leg."
879,It's one of the greatest phone I have ever seen and used ...Better then iphone in every wayGreat battery lifeOutstanding performanceVery happy with the product üòä
880,Camera quality is worst. Battery life and display is superb. Not worth buying
881,Nice cell
882,"Good for picture quality, to watch movies.Massive superb displayPop up camera is not fast as expected.Face unlocking is less faster than honor 8x."
883,Finger print reader in my phone gets freezed at times and doesn't work unless restarted again... At times doesn't detect my pinger print though finger placed correctly... :(
884,"OnePlus users, don't look for reviews to buy phone. Just go by the hype. Better than 7T. < 7T pro"
885,"One plus note 7 pro is an outstanding phone, camera quality, speed is excellent but the battery backup is so poor. After 3 to 4 hour while operating on internet, full battery was discharged..."
886,Amazing phone! Earlier I was using apple.. lots of people were like if u have used apple it's hard to get adjusted to Android but I'm finding the 1+7 pro a pretty neat and user friendly phone!
887,It is the best phone that gives you the biggest bang for your buck. Mind-blowing features coupled with a long lasting battery makes this phone a worthy contender for Android Smartphone of the Year 2019!
888,"Fabulous phone. Excellent quality, awesome screen display, excellent performance, camera quality awesome, finger prints super fast, battery life excellent and charging battery very fast.... Go for it..."
889,"Everything is good, fingerprint sensor work so fast, camera and daily/gaming performance is so good."
890,"This phone is really awesome.48k is a bit expensive Price.40k would be the best price for the product.Loved the camera quality, sound quality, display is wonderful."
891,"Dear Team,My new phone got an update request which i updated but after update the phone is not functioning and it is not on at all. I don't know what to do. Help me out.."
892,This is the first time I am using one plus handset and it is the best in the market as android phones go.
893,No return
894,"Fingerprint sucks, Instagram stories bugs, the camera too often pop up on Instagram.battery life not up to the mark.The performance of the device is good."
895,"Excellent camera, face unlock is lightning speed amazing mobile overall coming to browsing super speed compared to all flagship mobiles in android"
896,Amazing Phone... Flagship latest phone.As always OnePlus rules on the flagship phones market. Really liked the pop up selfie. Great battery life. So smooth display. And best is the edge view.
897,"One plus7 pro is just the phone I wanted. I strongly believe this is one of the best phones I have ever used. The camera is just amazing, the processor is too good.... With an amazing look!!!"
898,"wonderful but battery drains early,And gets slightly heated while video graphy being conducted."
899,"The device is so good, every thing is nice, but the battery and camera is not up to the mark, one plus have to work on it. Overall the performance is awesome, and in the matter of looks, it is cool üòé."
900,"Even after having 10 layer liquid cooling , it is heating."
901,Liked the overall look and performance of this masterpiece. Finally I've got a reason that there are better options than iPhone. Thanks One Plus.
902,"Without doubt, it's a beast.Only concern is weight and gaming UI, it will cut down the corners. Lots of setting required."
903,Phone is no doubt a great deal. Also little disappointment is that it doesn't have an ear phone jack slot. Bluetooth headphones available online are either too costly or are not trust worthy.
904,Worst experience with Amazon... Application like what's app is strucking and initially it had a booting problem also... I will never buy gadgets in Amazon hereafter.. worst experience üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
905,"Excellent performance , build quality, screen and speakers.Only disappointed by the lack of type c to 3.5 mm jack"
906,"Beautiful phone, best camera , you can't believe the clarity and colours in photos, Dolby Atmos sound quality is exceptional, I'm in love with this phone"
907,On first order phone was not even booting. Later on product was replaced and this phone also started hanging.
908,Soo much expensive as per money...
909,Absolutely amazing and blazing fast...truely admirable just go for the almond its flawless...looks elegent and shiny
910,No 1 3rd class handset this i already used OnePlus 5t so again i get new OnePlus 7pro but it's very very 3rd class handset not goodVery slow not good working i want to do return this mobile
911,Great all rounder.  Camera quality is good not the best but can compete with the best.  Screen is beautiful.  A true flagship.
912,Camera Quality need improvement
913,wonder fully amazing...only battery issue
914,Oneplus 7 Pro has been the Best Flagship Killer. It is Pricey But worth the money you put fot it.
915,"Sexy design and finishing.It gives you grand look! Mobile Camera and audio, video quality is number One. Keep it up OnePlus!"
916,Really great phone for the price range way better than XR and S10e.
917,"After 20 days using Lot to improve in camera , compare to 6T this camera performance is very poor even though it's a 48 mega pixel .Iam disappointed with main camera performance"
918,Worth every penny. Premium camera quality. Impeccable display. Finely crafted design. Lightening fast. What else does one want from a phone.
919,üíØ out of üíØ for battery life.Fastest fingerprint reader I have ever use.One of the bestest camera ‚ù§Ô∏èJust love in it
920,"Beautiful curves, faster than ever, but need to have color options in 6 gb ram I would  love to have  nebula blue"
921,"After a while, this one tempted to spend some amount,which turned out worth it's cost. It's definitely bit heavy, however so far whatever assured has been delivered. Proud owner of #oneplus."
922,Just.....WOW.....Brand Name is Enough To Say About Mobile.....Just... Amazing.....üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
923,"Product is good, but there is asetback with the sbi cc card offer.Dont go with the sbi card offer, amazon shows no cost emi, but actually in cc bill the interest is added."
924,Superb build quality and good camera quality. The screen is super smooth and fast. 90Hz refresh rate is amazing. Fingerprint sensor is slow and needs some improvement. Worth the wait!
925,Good but oppo and I phone compairing with 1+
926,Phone is working properly but some time double tap to wake up is working properlyAnd many times camera colour is yellow but still one plus update this problem is solved thankx to 1 +
927,"Hi ,I have purchased this and in one month Mike is not working.Please support."
928,"Camera is superb,operating is lightening fast."
929,So far so good. Love it. Awesome product. Worth buying it.
930,"Asusual, one of the best product by OnePlus. I personally prefer OnePlus over any other Android phone.Feels little thick after placing its transparent back cover."
931,"If it's a flagship killer, then it should be more value for money. Design should be more slimmer and less curvey. Camera should be more fine and accurate."
932,One plus has lost the originality as it was providing the best high configuration devices at bit value priced at it but I feel it is now taken by Mi brand
933,The best display in a smartphone ever! Add to that a brilliant camera and super fast performance. Clearly one of the fastest phone available in the market right now. Go for it without any second thoughts.
934,Battery life poor
935,The touch quality and screen resolution are superb. The only disadvantage is that the device is little bit bulky to carry as compared to the previous products from one plus
936,"It's speed and processers can't be matched.Money worth product.Apple,Samsung, or any brand is not even touching this one in this range...Happy to have it."
937,This product is as good as the hype created ...only one drawback which I felt not good Earphones port ....it's very painful without it...
938,"Best Product... Value for Money.... Great Built Quality, Smooth screen Decent battery life ... 30W fast charge.... Camera would have been great .... Overall good phone üòéüëå"
939,One of the best phone according to prize range .good camera quality battery life and one of the fast response.amazing display but having some heat issue which may later can be fixed
940,Fingerprint is very speedy...camera quality is 8 out of 10 and battery backup is awesome yaar..Most Beautiful thing of this mob is Its Display..u ll never settle about it...
941,Overall good just battery life more improve needCamera function also need improvement
942,It's amazing mobile for gaming
943,"I'm obsessed. Not a flagship killer anymore, rather it's a flagship now....the update are quite fast, and camera quality is getting better with updates...only negetive is little heavy to hold....rest are ""perfection"""
944,Best display ever and performance üëå . Battery could have been better.. It's awesome for one day use and chargesto 100quickly in 1hour
945,Hardly any change from the previous version except the pop up camera. 50k plus for this phone is way pricy. 1+ anyway hurts the emotions by bringing new model every now and then

949,I loved everything!üíùCamera quality is next levelüíØüëåBattery life is Crazyy. Sooo goodOnly thing that disappoints me is the fingerprint reader. It's doesn't seem working nice.
950,Fingerprint Sensor is pretty fast and accurate.Camera is upto mark.. but what can u xpct in this range.Battery life is gud.. depends upon the usage and how u charge frequently.
951,What a Phone ...it's a beautiful creation.
952,"One Plus 7 Pro is very good performance.  Phone battery is good backup, Display is best Quality , Cameras Quality is best every as i say every thing is good i will give 5 stars ."

974,"Its an awesome plus ultra phone....awesome pictures clarity awesome sound clarity , makkhan performance u will fall in love again...üòçüòçüòç"
975,Nice but not perfect
976,Nothing matches this phone in the price range. Camera can be improved but is still good in well lighted environments. Battery life is a definite advantage.
977,Everything is just suuuppppeeeerrrr about this phone.The only cons is...it's not waterproof(submersible)
978,"I genuinely liked the product , so beautiful designed with perfect edges  and performance wise also a killer,,, something everyone would fancy üòÅ and yesss easily delivered also‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÑüëç"

983,Best smartphone in market right now believe me it's worth buying everything is perfect and top notch screen is so crisp and vibrant OnePlus has done great job with this phone
984,"Battery is not up to good, if u using in 90 hz and high definition, otherwise otherthings r excellant"
985,"Fingerprint reader is lightning fast,Camera quality and both rear and front present clear and flawless clarity,battery is also pretty good even though with this performance."
986,"Superb product. I have been using this for almost 2 months years. Good battery life, awesome display. One plus never disappoints.Never Settle ü§ü"
987,Slow motion videos not clear it shows some reflection while taking slow motion video.
988,"I have no words for this device. This piece from onePlus is damn amazing. From battery, to camera, to 90Hz display. I just loved it all. Go for it iif you are ready to spend near 50K."
989,"Simply amazing. This is the only thing that I have to say. After using this device for 3 days, I must admit this is so far the best android device that one can buy."
990,All in one . I mean all the best feature in one mobile . It‚Äôs amazing 1+  boom all the other brands.
991,"good design, bit slippery camera is ultimate, sound quality is awesome but not worth of 49000 some time it hangs"
992,Nice and beautiful
993,"It was like my dream phone come true, really love one plus, especially the cameraüòç"
994,Best phone for Gaming and handling many apps simultaneously. There is no lag. The 90Hz refresh rate is very much helpful in game like PUBG. Wide Angle camera is so much clear and good.
995,It is not worth for money
996,1)Camera photo quality is inferior in comparison to galaxy s9 plus photos.2)screen legibility under the sun  is above average but is not excellent.
997,"After using 154 days I am writing this review. All good till now battery, display, speed, sound , fingerprint, OxygenOS everything awesome except camera."
998,A bit heavier than expected. Great quality. Beautiful body. Best camera. I was using One Plus 5t before so i found the battery life to be less than that.
999,Never had lag issues and the display quality is just great. Camera is much of a attraction but if you are not a selfie addict then it will just work fine for you.
