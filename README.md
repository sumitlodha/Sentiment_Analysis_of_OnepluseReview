Sentiment Analysis on OnePlus Reviews


Project Overview



This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis of product reviews for the OnePlus brand using Python. 

The goal of the analysis is to extract customer sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) from review data. By analyzing user reviews, this project aims to provide insights into how customers feel about the brand's products, identifying key issues, areas of improvement, and positive aspects.

The dataset consists of user reviews for OnePlus products and is used to train and evaluate a machine-learning model capable of classifying sentiment from textual data.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the review text, including tasks like tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming/lemmatization.

Sentiment Classification: Implements machine learning models to classify reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Visualization: Displays insights through visualizations like bar charts, word clouds, and confusion matrices.

Evaluation Metrics: Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language used for data analysis and model training.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.

scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): Used for text preprocessing tasks like tokenization, stop words removal, and stemming.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: Used for writing and executing the Python code in an interactive environment.

Project Structure

SentimentAnalysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all the code for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

OnePluseReviews1.csv: CSV file containing user reviews for OnePlus products.
